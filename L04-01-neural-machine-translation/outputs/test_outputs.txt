You know that what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a child, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather leather and never have no one farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell into you.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk about to you.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the guy in the class.
When I went to bleed to bleed every week in the children's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me get into the room of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to get out of the city.
I had a thumb, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years -- I felt the need to start working in organizations who fought against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that master <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that from adults we never got to know us.
You could <unk> Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to ask you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew about how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a <unk> and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle got closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica nearly 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around my water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even more to think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on the other <unk>
<unk> are born when you get from glaciers or break down the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, looking at a <unk> who are isolated separated and alone, as we see ourselves as human as human.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts is breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As an iceberg melts fresh fresh water in minerals that feeds in many forms of life.
I approach to photograph these <unk> as if it would be from the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique times there are only that way, and they will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when it comes to <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of his way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last photos I would like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually be able to witness a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an MRI.
About 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so <unk> our eardrum shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby.
Then, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of this, you're not going to pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X <unk> joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll get back to them later.
In my ground activity I will have two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> in training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that -- say, from human bodies, and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance is in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics are challenging social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional women.
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having sex that don't fit in the common or a female <unk>
So for example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks <unk> the body doesn't respond to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body becomes following a course by typically a female course.
When you look at the baby it looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After you put together you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like I -- I consider a female woman -- he doesn't know his structure -- I think being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> syndrome to <unk>
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, I had a life as a boy and he had just found out he had <unk> and <unk>
I had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk>
It had a 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, which essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it went to the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems, caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- that is, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies, are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they were getting to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings us into a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have a <unk> identity.
A very hard idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children are born like two people inside a body.
The greatest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> and he put his sex on the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether or <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we are all of us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we have to admit that these categories were -- we thought of these kinds of categories -- that we were going to have been <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we think about the science of science, we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the occupational categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all of the spheres of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body gets human, and it has a different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of it was going to put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved it yet.
If I stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extracting life organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we need to deal with the dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets me nervous.
I think that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every bit of watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
This is what happened in <unk> with <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were looking at was a <unk> concept, and they <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as all of you remember, what we were going to do is what we <unk> our own <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
Now, the monarchs didn't know DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power could be able to be able to be political power by the blood right of the father and then to the son, etc.
Parents were rejected by the idea and to replace it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered to be the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time will be interested in science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were getting rid of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be able to be a <unk> idea of birth to birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if we look, for example, the Declaration of 2009, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement for <unk>
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the front lines of Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people in the color of the <unk> about the <unk> difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep keeping certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they were supposed to allow you to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things to the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them -- Mary. was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was was born in term: was born from 1980.
For the fact that Mary had been born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the entitled to sexual consent to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because I was born later.
We find some other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being a man who is being considered to be a man now is <unk> from the realization that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary. Not for his hand, he doesn't have the same rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that are in many ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to be <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome -- and to marry a woman you have to have the y chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests of people <unk>
But this is also very strange about the story that I told you at the beginning of the syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I want to <unk> it provides a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond the anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be involved in this to help people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve the social services that some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> intelligent <unk> and <unk> about their sex relationships than people of 40 that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content on <unk>
It turns out very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've made a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we'll make good work in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to less <unk> unless they're willing to have a change in sex, in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon who talked about a couple years ago that I had made to give <unk> fraternal twins and then pick up their rap.
But when the phone asked her the reason for the surgery, he was a very <unk> operation -- he responded to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and so he had to do it.
And I said, "Well, he has considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are without <unk> to change the right of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if you think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate -- one of my advisers who I knew I was interested in in feminism <unk> was considered <unk> as <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I have heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there is nothing female in <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, the more I think there is something female <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while I loved them, they were very quickly aware to find the way to protect people by the state of the state, it's possible that to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched a concept of protection with support support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we get democracy beyond democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect and think about what we do for others.
Thank you.
In 2007 2007 I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinking about where they want to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count on a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just took us for buildings to apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in the apartment were either owners and that the other half is still not going to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem is that those buildings and areas that surround you have rules to avoid the pains and the distractions around the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place will be able to build it instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that governments were going to have new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> will come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> country by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential election, we <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
She asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental <unk>
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like <unk> and <unk> and usually the rules that keeps us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City that in some cases, it's worth thousands per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in terms of very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that would be stored there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> to me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and <unk>
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value into a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covering over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is about 3,000 square kilometers.
That's more than 100,000 <unk>
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The audience faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And they also bring new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government <unk> would need help from <unk> countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with that they would help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could also take a thousand square kilometers.
And a little bit later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to create these special developmental regions of development.
In a country that had just been going through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional stage was <unk> to one.
All the faces in the society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed away from the other voting voting to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 to 24 of February, an shifting <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korean <unk> it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after it spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would enable managers <unk> and maybe it would enable them to operate under a external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing her Supreme Court to be the court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know that they've already figured out that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go on to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million per year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go and get a job -- sometimes they are moms with just eating or buy their clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photographing and post in my blog with colorful and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people, usually my money is going to a good <unk> My mind is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like color color.
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we're going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what is somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I am.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I have put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else I would like to use after you got here to Palm <unk>
And I don't know how the woman who walks for TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned on this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call this brilliant.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
Almost you can always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> I have been <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in a week.
<unk> the color is <unk>
It's almost impossible to be impossible to be no humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not only do you <unk> you will also be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're wearing in.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to play the <unk> or I remind them for their little <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you're good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you're not good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I actually understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner inside, you don't see you can't look at it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people approached me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave in certain things.
I don't need to be involved with these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I look after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
So some of them would take one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most other quantum physicists -- we need quite a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
And as you can have developed that over the years that's the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at the time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet you play with that bar in that parking lot he taught a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things would not allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars play with these tiny, little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was a few years later, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects that are around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why they shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the kind of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just right at the center.
And then here we make a good approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, as a trampoline a springboard and which is moving into a platform.
And then I made this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a fresh silicon chip and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable that is being on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up and leave it out of doing those things, because I don't want to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> from inanimate objects are not just people, but it's the light that <unk> and the wind going on on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put a <unk> then you put a <unk> and pulled it all the air down, and then you get it down to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as well.
So we measured their movements.
We found it moving in very strange ways.
Instead of getting perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way he <unk> it was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't think at the same time -- something that happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on a single atom -- and that little metal piece is about the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my part of the logic of speech.
So imagine if you were in many places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body were <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we lit the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal still there on one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief <unk> which allowed me to do that.
It took me 18 months and so forth.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were going to be fascinated by 17 museums.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining to just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a lot of education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and went into museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So let's better show you the demo of this, and to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the New York museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the flat plane, and with a click, we jump in.
They're inside, which wants to go at the end of the hall,
Come forward. That would be <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign there.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get to have with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started playing play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this looks <unk>
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called the <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole on the <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get closer and closer and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move away the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is for coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this work <unk>
It goes up and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool thing. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked out -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we just got a zoom in there.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, even even comes from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium makes justice for its artwork and which is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You know, you did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin -- all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened to be a really interesting thing about race careers one in the last two decades.
There was some time, if you wanted to win a race of Formula 1 took a budget and you put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you earned the race.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, it will make real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers on the open.
And as <unk> they're beginning to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As soon as I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the atoms that are going to be <unk> and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end he took the <unk> and he threw it into the <unk> -- you can still see a little <unk> a <unk> and he said to her, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment.
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and taking something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember -- they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end of I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the afternoon early there are people here and there by doing call <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go into the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night, everybody went to <unk> to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everybody went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then all the world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the age of <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but about things we use and consume.
We now know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how do you get?
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags that are going to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started a few volunteers to help us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are in all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't even exist.
They're going on very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if you look at all the days that the cup is not going to be gone, which is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that is still still there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some change <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public space in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates a <unk> of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels on them, you can write them, show patterns, images.
And when the curtain is going to be open so that we can actually go on, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it.
And I would bring a commission to design the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you come up and open it up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the <unk>
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like this.
Those days will always be somebody, when the roof comes down the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but that when most of the architecture goes down almost all architecture away.
Here's how it works.
You see the people <unk> so it goes on inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let you come up, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes and one had to jump to <unk>
<unk>
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things and people use.
This is a picture of the building with the socially pixels and the pixels of water and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and every single one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
Could we make this cloud,
This is a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be able to be a <unk> cloud of the one that you can get close, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them <unk> for a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance dancers of today, the star of the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left-hand side, you see the <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement.
It can push all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something to the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment <unk> as a farm farm as a calf <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world into the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, how we can use the networks to the physical world.
In our case, this might want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to deal with the challenges of today: think about climate change or the CO2 emissions. How do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, collectively, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud they are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered by pixel alone.
You can move inside, you can have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to share the main moments of the London Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of heaven as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could better make it better, for a more accurate more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure yes.
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to take creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> You probably had the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many people choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you a look at a doctor about it.
The great geneticist in the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
refers to others or us?
This is another look to the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right at an end, it is, of course, what more we do.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval there have been maybe 20 or 25 species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same <unk> chemically <unk> that comes out of the pancreatic line.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the most bacteria than the cells we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think ... when Antonio <unk> does it raises the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is an amazing environment for those bacteria.
It is warm up in it that is very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that they can want without effort on their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some rush <unk>
But by the other, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would we do?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and unique <unk> and human life, a little note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it wrong.
When I was just introduced to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms, each cell just divide and all the genetic energy from that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes into the electronic reproduction.
And a very important thing, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body is in evolution at the same time in sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel door to it.
He opens the door.
In front of him, he finds a magnificent <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to get us healthy.
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to take the genome to the next <unk> adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are sort of <unk> rockets for sending the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think they all took the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to be <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily respond to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily respond to the biggest or the stronger or the stronger and even more smart.
Evolution favors the best creatures to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be, if there were fish there, fish could be <unk> but yet they have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what this means when we look at what's going on in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look at the way back to the <unk> phase. I would argue that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and made from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so scared that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation so that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution can touch slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> species -- distant planets, are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive possibility and intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the choices that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for the society, but it's what you choose to do on the individual and a family level.
Think also if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to the close to 20,000 dollars.
Not too much to get the human genome for <unk> and it's getting more and more to the reach of all.
They get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they will induce <unk>
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course with the flu flu <unk> in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then two little <unk>
You can change the cells from their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate your diabetes, eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who don't want more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to have <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could marry the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why not have a faster muscle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in the conditions of passing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that might normally take 100 thousand years and we can go back to 1,000 years and maybe something happened in the next 100 years.
These are choice that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a more successful society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what it might be <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk about with flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
And the pilot had taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
So the pilot is going on the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
You get the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words that I've heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight flight.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. It was <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to absorb all the experiences that I've ever wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines out.
Because if wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is the time we <unk> the bridge George Washington, which wasn't quite much -- I thought about, Wow, I feel a great deal.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave a place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have no reason for <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock goes on <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I am saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, dying of no fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small guy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I get to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was given a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You know, you're flying the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be like this -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What is it that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> <unk>
One day she came to her home after he was running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today we have total complete paralysis,
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation so, of course, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> saw Stephen <unk> not that all of the people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're someone important and you have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Someone in the movie <unk> <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I stood up with his brother and his father in that very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony goes to speak, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who is so much inside your inside cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser pointer -- draw over that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with sex organs then with bad words, after the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in its <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things on one side to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that you could have a machine that would have a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's more <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy with the guy who gets an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers around the world <unk> from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we would do something totally stupid and that when they were going, they would have taken out the frames of the walls and then there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the Harvard <unk> walk my son was part of my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They're a pair of heavy sun glasses that we bought at the <unk> <unk> ride some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, the <unk> we put it on a light light bulb and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up, we release the code <unk> the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There are no hospital that I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person in another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after about a year of planning, two weeks of planning, about intense <unk> of all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the outside hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this -- he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out of there so that I could get <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a certain way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong took something about us and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 <unk> inventions and it was really cool.
The best thing about all this -- and this is what ends up about closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at April <unk> in the center of Los Angeles at the center of Los Angeles in the center of Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in the urban urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a writer -- I never did anything with <unk> technology I simply recognized something, and I was excited about wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do all the days when we can find them with something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years ago in situations usually very difficult and at the same time so dangerous as much.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
Film in areas of <unk> hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days a day eating just this fun -- a lot of fun in the middle, very dangerous in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I have been interested in situations in situations in horrible situations with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that <unk> attractive, interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that they were looking and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and how I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent a few messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What there was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good opportunity to go on.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of name.
If you had asked me a year ago I hadn't been able to marry certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we examined the <unk> world.
And as I said earlier, I have gotten myself into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be allowed to be <unk> for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tried to try to make products from products, and marketing and advertising, and that all of the film will come together with <unk> and marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to be called "The largest <unk>
What happens in "The greatest film ever <unk> is that everything from top at the bottom, it has images of it, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were attached to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X to the title -- but we're going to make sure that we are testing all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe <unk> a shoe and becomes the most great shoe you've got to <unk>
The most cool car that you've ever driven in "The greatest <unk> ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> <unk> from "The greatest <unk>
<unk>
The first film of the film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the shot from beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money does it do to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big marks on the big brand.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of the movie will see us as a bunch of fucking <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he's going to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one, all of these companies actually disappeared.
None of us wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, and it's not the idea to tell with that new <unk> vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a mistake, <unk> and that mistake was this one.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are going to happen.
I like your <unk> <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> President <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it something very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  -- like that weird bear still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this little rural road.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We put a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to be <unk> history.
We want them to make a story, but we want to make them <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would love me in any lie -- and there he is there looking at me as <unk> saying, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
Is your story, it's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I met John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take a proxy and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant <unk> and others who make small films -- independent films like mine.
And my friends who make movies of large <unk> they say that the reason their movies are so successful for the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make movies say, say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little anxious.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would offer one of these <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man as a solid, solid, <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the overall story.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a little brand.
<unk> the smallest kind of films that <unk> we're rather <unk>
So we don't have the budget they have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people -- is the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something audacious, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you very cool.
How do we keep ourselves cool longer?
Things like those who are going to make the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What's about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Get my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> A little bit of <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, lots of gray colors, lots of gray and things like that.
They usually wear like sunglasses, or <unk> or <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of a <unk> part of <unk> on <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out there because I would have <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be an Tom, but I would often tell me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped for companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality of brand.
If you could do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
AT: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
AT: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think that your world is the world in which they are going to do, like people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and they start in a place and in my case they started and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next one you want to talk?
MS: Next is the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and how it will be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like <unk> I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> what do you do?
What's the <unk> What is <unk> What happens now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> Thank you.)
AT: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> A: <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness on this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but it was <unk> in your personality of <unk> the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They get very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are just going to become one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that are not <unk> and avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them the <unk> and you actually get a good thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is classical <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands that these things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to take your personal identity, your personality of brand, which would be?
Are you a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more likely to be an indicator of it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary and bold and bold like <unk> <unk> quick or <unk> -- <unk> -- magic or mystic terror -- like <unk>
Or are you more attribute to <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated like <unk>
You're a traditional place, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, good, safe, sacred, sacred, or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would not have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they are using MRI resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain to be so much for commercial marketing as a movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned open-air advertising,
All over the city for the last five years there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way into schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or that I've been most successful in the ones that I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how he has gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just about a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, nor TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies we talked about to their customers won't be part.
I have always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks -- that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people of that that's pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss of risk is preparing their whole company for <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll go forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
More than a little bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> they bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So then, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket -- I have a check to the name of the TED array organization, the Foundation <unk> a check for <unk> to be applied to my next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer <unk> is really very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and leverage them, we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus out of Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, so we're smart.
This is the <unk> plan.
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enters the gray box, damages <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes.
That was called the attention, and we started an experiment where we would put our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they were very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after you experience different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking in an active box in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect itself is actually working on that place: it's actually working on that place: it's actually working on that place: is actually working on that place: it's actually working on that place: it's actually working on that place: it's actually working on that place:
It doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
Could be, say, for example, a power plant plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two <unk> and a small one and a big.
We also saw that they were very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
You get all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much they <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks quite like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We then were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with them with the real world with potential potential goals of the world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about targets, we remember it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a valuable, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and asked them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked quite well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to <unk> the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number of <unk> shows up in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to research scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it became better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
That gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had with each other.
In order to have no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been there after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends, and we had to start back again.
Still, we discovered that both digital <unk> would sell to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six water and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined that what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really would be <unk>
There is the gray box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing does is it is to intercept the stock values of sensors for example of the pressure sensors and the vibration of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great, yeah?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant -- when the large turbine turbine goes from speed, you must open out of escape in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither the <unk> and the safety system will be able to do it.
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant or in a factory factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden on a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you want, is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better that we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The motor behind this is the <unk> cloud.
There's one itself, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take you and give <unk> abilities or another one that makes users of lawn chairs.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets put in the morning, gives you a big force in addition to your speed, and helps it for example, to drive balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other amazing things.
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must lead to a load of 45 pounds, and it's being allowed to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or the <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the brain-controlled exoskeleton -- I can put it up 90 pounds per terrain for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to be able to be able to put together <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of wheelchair, what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in advance of wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is really a conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a lot of very young people, very young people in the column that when their life would start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population of the older people that are blown rapidly.
Your only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19, 19 years ago he had a injury in the neocortical column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk>
It's got about sensors ...
It was completely not <unk> in the crutches that they send signals to the board on board here on the back.
There are some batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and you make it progress with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a stranger in the air, skiing in the air, skiing in <unk>
In a second, I lost a whole feeling and all the whole movement of her <unk>
Soon time later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding on a <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and to all the users of the wheels of <unk> everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos of the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their living closest parents.
That means that we all share a common ancestry an evolutionary grandmother, which lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos tell us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large guys, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where violent violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to get them.
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that's been sustained for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The hunting and deforestation trade and deforestation makes you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you might hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes, <unk> love, not <unk> because they have sex, <unk> <unk> and <unk> to deal with conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
With it, we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the pitch Bonobo sees the roots of their laughter, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is largely in Bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing involved elements in the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game needs and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like that, sometimes we play ourselves, and explore the limits of our inner and outside of the outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to go to explore, interact with, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are only little samples of the understanding that the Bonobo Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world to greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's go back to the maximum <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
To bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems less appropriate to play, it can be the moments where it's more <unk>
And so in that, fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, your friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where the volunteers were clinging to a highly qualified staff -- you have to get to the fire site, very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a career on the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I met the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner of the owner that was certainly one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she stood out in the rain, under a <unk> in his head, in his head, he was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I was going to get before me -- he would say, <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go back and save the dog owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or some money <unk> that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a burning building to save a live alive just because he won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go into the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and I bring it to this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen <unk> that at that height and less they had finished turning on the fire and entered the fourth main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house to the owner of the house where, as it was to expect, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort that was shown to save his house.
The kindness she was looking at the other was that someone had achieved even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a volunteer ideal, I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also <unk> acts and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have done before, or are there by doing remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't wait.
Don't wait wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you will go right now.
We put food in a dining room, a park park in the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save your life from someone but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So you trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the particular block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of cement from a fixed measure that fits with each other.
Very quickly, these became the most possible construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges or an brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
About a hundred years later, in 1947, to 1947, it came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion <unk> or every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or so.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the particular block of concrete, the <unk> in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> aesthetic <unk> each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuits and more complex circuits at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are going on to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing is that they join through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the cloud, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly you can start to grow older circuits.
A blue with one green is producing light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it <unk> faster or slower -- just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing area.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get into <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, it all must be accessible.
We've been given to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how a light does, or why the door to an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought them into design schools.
So for example, designers with no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the School of Rhode Island, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in thick and wood and paper -- and we said, Make something something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon <unk>
But hang on, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all the design design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So I'll go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for getting involved with the environment.
They distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
Can you take a little bit in <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, you know, I mean, you know.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> a few members every year and put them to work with <unk>
Instead of putting them to the Third World we send them the wild world.
They made big <unk> worked with <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone is being trapped when she is stuck in the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered for a meter of snow.
How did I ask for the help of this very <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time I spent a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens would be able to <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you are."
When you do that, you put him a name, in this case, he got <unk>
If you don't do, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the U.S. government.
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City, when you see this app that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people would steal the batteries.
So he asks citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to get people to get to clean up sidewalks with sidewalks when they were.
So now we know nine cities that are using using it.
And this has spread <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology -- you know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software generally takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that the normal canals would have taken at least two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the California judicial system, which is the time two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that comes into a couple of days and spreads in a viral form is kind of <unk> <unk> to the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies as many people think it should be.
It also doesn't like a technological company, but rather than the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're really good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They have a great frustration for that, but they don't have a lot of frustration to do that but they don't get it down.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we get mad at, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics doesn't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it has to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the heart of telephone and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined <unk> at the bottom of the official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open up the doors of the house, put good music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
And Boston has no call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We didn't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened to come up with this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamic dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income to partnership with distributed voluntary collaboration,
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to help and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it might have been connected to the government services, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input from the other.
That our input to the government system is a vote.
How many times have you chosen to a <unk> We sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will alter our values and make our own needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
So below it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> what it keeps us out of that is that we funded as something that is happening against us, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work -- we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government works.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've got them wrong.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That's not activism for political activism it's activism <unk>
And for those of us that we have <unk> in front of the government, it's time to ask ourselves what world world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't abandon government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> only there is to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of the members of our members is 28 years old than me, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who goes to <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express their opinions at any same time and they do it.
So when you face the problem of the government doesn't really care about asking your voices.
They're using hands.
They bring hands to the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, not only by the government of the government that we pay taxes and get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or maybe we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED seeing and hearing these stimulation has given a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic <unk>
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family house, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way he looked at the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then get me down.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching myself, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I would tell me again and if I told him that yes, I kept in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to wish to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at it and she <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, he took me out of his hand, and he said, "Come on <unk> The two will be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now forgive him, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget.
And then he said to me, "I want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to ask me, is that you always want your <unk>
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to ask me, is that you're always going to do the right thing though the right thing is to be <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> That's how we <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in southern rural. I have a brother a year and a sister a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, 15, my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I, and we went for the forest.
We're just doing the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he gave him to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me at <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I went into the <unk> and <unk> "Ah, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe you can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should be able to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the biggest <unk> incarceration rate.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much <unk>
One of the three black men in the age of 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and laughing that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that defines the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We're <unk>
I find interesting.
We're looking at our work in some good developments that are curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you will get rid of rights forever if you have a <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the male population population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it over to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was <unk> the law of the right vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it gets to <unk> children to die in prison.
We have in this country in jail for children, no chance to go out ever.
Right now, we're in some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, we have been able to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have been identified as innocent which is <unk> and released from death row from death.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent man in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation we would never allow you to fly airplanes if every nine <unk> would be <unk>
But somehow we get to the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history, <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We don't really know a lot of this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a defined as defined by the terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you delivers talks, <unk> people who stop saying that in our history that you stop saying that in our deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of routine and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we would go through with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage you with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's good enough to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, <unk> and <unk> we would put people to <unk>
Tell us about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, things positive and marvelous they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. Despite being so rational, so rational, so <unk>
With innovation -- development comes not just of brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from ideas, also by the heart of the heart.
This connection of mind is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being on places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect there with the technology and the design, that allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, for injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I called me to say <unk> come up with the <unk>
Do you want to come and get it.
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well what do you do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was a very powerful thing.
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me, and he said, "Now, let me give you a tell me that this idea of <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about the death row.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of me, and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At the time, Ms. <unk> <unk> got his finger in the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I believe that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been working on simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher than we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> it's not <unk> us by our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they deal with the rich and they treat the rich people and <unk> but for how they treat the poor, steal them.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I sometimes feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients in 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> to be told as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who isn't it?
The judge would be sold as an adult, but I see a child.
One night later, I was awake <unk> for God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, they must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was later, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14-year-old client -- a tiny, poor white.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my 14-year-old client was treated like a white <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there were been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country, there are no ethical but a whole lack of ethics in it.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it was sent to the cut.
About two months, I had forgotten about.
And then finally -- Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got down from the car. I walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "That's you. <unk> I said yes.
So I approached me and <unk> me.
And I stood up with the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I said, <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, so I'm talking about races, because we were talking about races, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I saw the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window, and you get to hear all that <unk>
I'm walking down here and there.
Finally, this old black <unk> got into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge took a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> <unk> he showed himself upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> over the old black man.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up, I looked at the <unk> he looked at me and he looked at me and he said, <unk> to this <unk> room to tell this young man to keep her view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today at TED today because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds to court.
That we cannot be truly human beings -- if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, to those of you who are dealing with this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, from this community, to help in your own purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to <unk> the funds they are being spent in policy today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases in homicide was not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get nowhere.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds were going to be turned into the law, to the security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the people who think is that?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The large growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence.
It's the wrong war for drugs.
That's why this is a dramatic rise in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people together in order to break down a bicycle, for small crimes for small crimes against property instead of making that resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does not do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you been excited to be <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting so much more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop all of this data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make any harm.
So of course, from a <unk> of stories, we look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And given that all digital devices provide us negative news, the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress ever done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the extinction extinction of species, water shortage, and we have no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems -- and in the long run, we just just had them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> income per capita income for inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food and electricity and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy occurred 25 percent more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living on an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would get it.
And we keep <unk> expectations and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, a lot of people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, no <unk> and the telephone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So much of this is technology and, lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the performance at about 12 to 24 months.
By the reason the mobile phone in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, and in <unk> in depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it turns out goes up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and food and food, digital medicine and food <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to human beings."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the perception of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and, in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, it would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about to take that <unk> and make it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story about Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops had covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than the gold and <unk>
So the end of the Washington Washington rate is aluminum <unk>
You see, although the aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth mass, it doesn't come as pure metal as well.
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made it so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
I will bring this analogy into the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet, we are moving for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 energy <unk> every 88 minutes.
It's not about lean but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT was published by a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of America, solar power will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's now talk about the wars of water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
They were looking at a very famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's capable of generating a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any source, saltwater, water, water <unk> by less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just finished thinking about hundreds of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola will implement this globally in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation of this technology that it exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better cell phones in the middle of Kenya that the president has 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So the things that you and I have paid tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video of books and music, technology -- diagnostic technology -- now they are <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get into the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device with whom you speak, and because it has <unk> you can be able to <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there's healthcare workers.
When this <unk> device is a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just got a brand of the <unk>
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll spend two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion of our minds never before <unk> that add up to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What <unk> What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And most health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you provide three million more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
How about a few voices never had to <unk>
How about if we give them to you everywhere they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 million?
And if you are to contributions we can't afford to.
One of the things that I learned with the X Prize, is that young teams and guided by their passion with an hour, you can do things that were <unk> things that could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this, university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came in, and they started <unk>
And it has been shown today that the machinery of recognition of human patterns is best folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to get us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You might think that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And it described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught it so much to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red List of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they follow <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I was very burnt with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The rodeo was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20, the <unk> <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was getting over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped down in half.
I read about five inches.
They have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was actually imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this very crappy boat, he was called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the Indian Sea, and above all, on the Aral Sea.
And what we captured there, was something <unk>
<unk> I now know, sea bottom.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> small spots on top <unk> that are fish from coral reefs.
In summary, the sea fund came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The bottom is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains, is what the fishermen collect every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But there is no <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we didn't remember it.
It will take the point of starting the new level, not remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> things -- biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the <unk> images in the beginning of their conscious life as a normal thing, and we tested it forward.
The difference is they perceive loss loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end to keep the <unk> <unk>
And that, in large extent, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting the people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is thin.
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with large fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> like a captain of a captain of the way that I saw a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, usually they don't use the scientists of fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the huge role that can accomplish a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and it's very low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they serve, which allows them to delete their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Midwest, for example?
I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the harbor Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were very touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why they would be <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only thing to give, is the only thing to give, it's <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are doing viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, it copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can become famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And, of those, only a small percentage is viral gets lots and countless visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators communities of participation and factor.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my gosh, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popular amount of last summer.
<unk> not intended to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this reminding you to get video to popularity percent.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present to us with new things and interesting things to bring them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants you to get in the weekend, the weekend.
<unk> from Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have popped out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> de <unk> Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators are going to take a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation animation with a <unk> music.
That's so, that's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird -- you know that there is a three million hours that has seen four million times.
So even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats watching the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old one.
And then it became international made.
All of a sudden, a whole community emerged from a <unk> community that made this going to happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today it's not just <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Jack <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What could it have been written to be written by this situation?
In a world where two video days go up two days of video per minute, just that really unique and unexpected can be <unk> in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that he had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't too interested in too much.
Casey <unk> And I would not circular for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keeps you completely properly from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> achieved that five million watched and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth of all the new things we make in a creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- of a new kind of culture, where we all have access and is the audience which defines the popularity of popularity people.
As I said earlier, one of the world's current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> began on YouTube.
You don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we are all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the current media characteristics -- but we will bring the entertainment in the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of her country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much while friends, now we get it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I would have it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 when her father died, and marriage died, and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for the <unk> of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat was so slid into the hot sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were villagers, rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were going to take it first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were fooled by the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not be able to leave for six hours.
But I do remember the lights from the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I knew given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, it was <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations, giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> an <unk> class class -- whose population is comprised of immigrant
Unlike the middle-class suburbs whose existence would be <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English fragments <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line working on six days.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT IT <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and they put an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two pairs of high school for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
home.
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I would <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until the <unk> they started to <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then he studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They were prepared subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classical student -- relentless with what it was from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them had been given from the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of a lawyer, the young Australian young Australian young Australian young Australian young Australian young Australian kid.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't go down.
As <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as well as refugee refugee and social activist invited to talk to sites that I had never heard about, and in houses whose existence would have never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the routines. And to the comfort of life in a suburb -- <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> over the day of every single single bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got the boat.
I'd never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was <unk> to talk about.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what <unk> living on the border of possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> race.
So there was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new ones in the scene -- not just that it's fine, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world would be <unk> but not the way we fear.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for the people who the motto can't be <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> until the entrance at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones and we open it up.
I made a decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before you end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person he cared.
Life didn't change for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and he took the cause she himself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't be done proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower of a hotel hotel when she died, to 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell them stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
He came up at night, and he told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why her hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"They don't have it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life created us, we can now see that the men who would have reached our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for this?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, diving brave in each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon.
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them a safe and you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today, in the fourth and fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and pick them up the sky.
Now we do it with an airplane for it.
At that time, when you get the great master warrior Indian warrior -- I was <unk> I took a bow and grab an <unk> into the floor, he could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we got out was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great amount of that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and see a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow magic to do not <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me his home silver <unk>
And this kind of technological piece of 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became an golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense of mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
And we would make our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I was sent to this technological world to see how it was using magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books since 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device that is able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
They put the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And this --  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
At many times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the GPS -- that comes to me.
My little girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that they were teaching of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned out to me exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And you actually light your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy on a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I moved into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In the whole book of fantasy there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and drives you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, they also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and in contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child child <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been able to be able to get into their <unk> to their <unk> have not come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to get this back in the back of the childhood you have to go out and in a chapter, a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside of the variants of connection between magic and the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book -- we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and using augmented reality and using a <unk> <unk> which shows you about the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves of leaves at a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are correlated with technology and magic and technology comes to each other.
It takes power of the sun.
We're getting our children and ourselves into the natural world and to that magic and joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of his listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the greatest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I got stuck.
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my medical doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when I need to be <unk> or some urgency of that like that, but I saw it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 3,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi road and before it comes up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a lunch lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's a pressure pressure that is used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move into the people of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week it's going to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were taking them from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to recover control and to be thrown out of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges we face, like the firing of costs for <unk> attention and other issues.
They make techniques that are simple to use and start with this to involve patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video with a video.
We all have any controls of sailing in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know exactly where ATMs are ATMs in <unk>
And also where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked you, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes they sometimes open up in <unk> office and other ones are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they already were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality.
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and at the next few weeks to use your cellphone <unk> to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to be on the world level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the <unk> <unk> around the world.
Every time you go from vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies all over the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be a message services or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please forgive me in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started the press <unk>
<unk> like this: building a <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And yet, it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time but with the common goal to keep the level of it.
And when I say realism I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to seem to be captured in a way as photography.
I would agree when you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with getting a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
Will light?
What is it that creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there was.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It's really going to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture looks like <unk> I think these are those in which we don't even overcome the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos has to have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are done with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, even I made the red house on the top of the island to make it more <unk>
So in order to make an realistic outcome of it, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
And then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful, and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing the details, but the general aspect of it.
It's about an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other ones that we usually see, is kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale scale.
So I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something that happens.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we solve technology at scales.
The answer is that if you draw it in a normal curve where you say, say, these are the years, or some time unit, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to take on the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you take an example, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gets a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport is how fast it goes as fast as the past <unk> we could take on a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But we don't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't still forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
You get one of two things.
Or is it going to become a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe going to happen like this.
It will be like that, now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask about, and to ask myself, is: what is that new shape that <unk>
So what new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are immersed in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something going on.
It takes a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how it might be, how that transition is going to be.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I would like to do is do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So you go back about two 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great rock rock with a lot of chemicals that will spread around them.
If you look at the way that these chemicals were organized to give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there is theories to start understanding the origin with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is, at that time, there was a few oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical prescriptions inside.
Some of those drops of oil had been a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and then the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> mobile forms of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to bring chemical chemicals -- they will get more chemicals and get more <unk>
Most of them lived over time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple, but things would be interesting to be interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> we can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide to foreign security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this little piece of DNA and then <unk> it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to have 100 million copies of my personal card, and I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would put it into a virus and have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells very happy about another billion years.
But then another big step there was interesting at which things are very different -- and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming so many of these cells forming these cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that in a way, were put together in that way, and a bunch of <unk>
In that way, or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community were getting more and more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the turning point happened when these communities were so close to, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe in the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have a lot of different types of cell communities working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not without the heart of the heart, or the brain of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and become more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they weren't doing more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community as the <unk> structures of <unk> understanding and transmitting information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the time period of time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit, because I knew so bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these accelerated information structures -- enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we make it sound, in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started making <unk>
Now we spend by periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing <unk>
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the video tape, <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we would do before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which some evolution produced with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scale of time again.
The first stages of the story I told you about took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
So the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And those, like the electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess, <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the more it does.
And I think that's what we see in this burst of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the advances in recent computer.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to communicate in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that information machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that you could not could, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please play a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these scripts of instructions at random, to run all these programs, and take the ones that are <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say that I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to present numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the order right.
And I said, "You could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They put those and put them to the rest.
And now I would argue that I better <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and the children will make the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of computer programs that had a little bit more successfully.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
They put some mutations in.
And he tries again and tries to communicate with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few thousand milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that you sequence is absolutely perfect.
In fact, it's a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are strange TV programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I have the safety that they get the goal because they come from a bloodline from hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I once went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do different design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make much faster computers and so we can run these programs much more rapidly.
I mean, they are <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was born.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to afford to give up a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat my talk, I talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, there is the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> which <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> 10 of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> the first base doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
And by the way, that's somebody who is 10 strokes, and he gets to four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player from the League of the League <unk> <unk> to run over 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's look at this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are a surgeon who has also a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place, and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and their family doctor derived a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She is remarkably getting this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you think should be the average of a heart surgeon, or a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse <unk>
It's very good.
And the truth of the issue is nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is to go to the world, and I included in the world of being perfect.
That never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do good.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Like which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the hospital residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all memory.
Out of my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic is frequent <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were <unk> it would know everything, or as possible as possible, close to everything, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident at a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency service to the emergency service where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I applied to the E.R. I applied to a cardiologist to me to go to that patient.
and reporting to the Chief
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into your lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there is difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would love with.
I gave him <unk> and <unk> to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that it could be able to eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> the sent to his house.
I actually made two mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the Chief
I didn't get up the phone, and I didn't have what I should have done, he was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring up information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even <unk>
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, he didn't take care of a voice on my inner phone, which would say, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so unsure that I even asked the nurse that he would join the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm good."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed the tall, and the ambulance together with the ambulance together with her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad fit in your stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I would try to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency service service on home.
And there is another nurse, not what he was doing from the lady in the lady before, but other words, he told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors in <unk>
Other specialists fear it too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the <unk> patients.
The three words are <unk>
<unk> from the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the brink of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her the tall, she suffered a collapse and his family called the emergency room on the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff would take away all its resources.
They gave her medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
It had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was hoping against all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of course, it was clear that we never will.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days old, they were <unk> what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her to go. The wife -- wife and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was excited about that and I experienced for the first time, <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat down with <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't marry your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I am sure I would take things and make sure that I didn't get to me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made an error so <unk>
Why do I chose medicine?
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day <unk> opened up the sky and eventually went out, and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I put the efforts in order to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would always cease to stop.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it would happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in the northern hospital in Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little <unk>
He took him out of penicillin, and he sent it to his house.
But as he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> change my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but on the upper side, and it can cause the close to those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
You get antibiotics and antibiotics and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to be at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't think it was a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
It turned out an X-ray shot, but it turned out a normal one, a colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity on the bottom right quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and as a certain sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
They both were operated on.
But every single case I would love to do is <unk> me.
But I would like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
They get embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't afford to talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
So how do I show this that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard about failure, talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital hospital the wrong leg, trust me that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who can't sleep, those who can't sleep and the ones that I know; those who have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will stay safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal staff study and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the <unk> Toronto to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every single day -- where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system that infection are getting more and more, causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die of 24,000 <unk> by medical <unk>
The U.S. Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And this is what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I breath up to alcohol, and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professionals prone to error, well, not to be anyone.
And with regard to people who don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white art, art -- it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students would be able to go down to slow down your head and send them into saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human knows, you accept it, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what's happened to teach others.
They take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They make mistakes of other people with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and of the support for everyone to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a doctor <unk>
I'm human, making mistakes of mistakes.
And I feel so much, but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
So recently I made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to choose a half American American, it's about 70 a day.
Not a lot ago, in research went through a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks by these executives and the time that they were going to be able to make things related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do they get the way that deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choice to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your response is positive for you please give a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> at the University of very, very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked me, why do I never buy anything?
This is the shelf from the <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, "Well, do this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
They put a <unk> at the entrance to the store.
We put there <unk> from six <unk> or from 24 flavors and we see two things: First, where people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
They stopped when there were only three percent of you stopped when we had only three percent of it came to buy <unk>
If there were six, when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we will probably be allowed to get less -- it's less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices is affecting good decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this didn't bother us.
Now the theme of the day, the energy savings.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings on retirement savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans for this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of money <unk> available in savings plans to retirement, the <unk> program will bring people to save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they want.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the larger the number of options, more people will be able to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much as you had more options, they were more willing to invest in market market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize to optimize the financial financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences of having to offer more and more possibilities.
They're more likely to make the decision, the decision, even though this is going to go against their own interest.
They're more likely to take the world's worst decisions in the health and health.
They are more likely to pick less likely to choose less <unk> <unk>
The main reason is that we would be able to look at that variety of giant <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to compare to the contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have built in one way or another, in different research, so they can rehearse in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People always laugh when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're seeing is actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to be cut, to get rid of odd options, there will be an increase in sales, save the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for women's <unk> that less <unk> were raised <unk> in <unk> for two major sales and under costs.
It is known to you on average today, on average, offer 45 products.
In a Walmart store they offer about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think that one of the best examples that have come up on how to manage the choices is David <unk> the <unk>
Every Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe journey.
Those of you who really want a choice is they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they cannot be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I talked to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience on vacation with all of them to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give a hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> All right. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
So that people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each other, and that the consequences must feel very narrow <unk>
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average when they use debit card or credit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive people.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that they were exactly like <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we would get to the staff who would think of the positive things that they would put in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine corridor to do.
We saw that in the retail Wall <unk> across the <unk> <unk> display can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other one is called <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This <unk> framework is totally useless.
And the categories have to indicate something about the <unk> not when they were <unk>
So you often see this problem with these huge lists of funds.
Who are supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think about, if you just put it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision about the purchase of a car.
This is a German maker car that allows you to completely <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, and put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> out of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decision does.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, at a few hours, four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you deal with you are.
If you get older, always the default button in every decision, it indicates they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We find that those who go from many choices to few times, <unk> the <unk> button over and over again, and more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they go there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information is.
If we started with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of changes would not tell you about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories from less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who work.
I think the key to getting the best of choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our own choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East Germany <unk> if you had a typewriter to write it before the government.
I had to register a text sheet, written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a script with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much that we would do with freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you back into your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the Web.
If you see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are we <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> of the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, large amounts of it.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> who would give money to their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, Anderson, and so on, etc., etc.
These guys make their online <unk> but they made it by illegal media using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> stands for <unk> don't know their <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us might be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong in worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance we're looking at today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, and they motivate them the protests, to motivate them opinions, they motivate you laughter.
And groups like Anonymous have been <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the United States of the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of the government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority from <unk> or actually it was.
<unk> <unk> last fall of a <unk>
And I would raise the safety of the site and carried out a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if you say, <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you do?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority was foreign authority.
And they were going to give you <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police in April, 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder, called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes of a company based on Germany that had been sold in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 500,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this for themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to research its own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we might be able to trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we are going to do today will be forever.
<unk> blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of National Park.
This is the cows from my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions go down, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of <unk>
Men were dying of our community they protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions they killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to the nine years is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought male lions were afraid.
But I realized that it actually didn't be <unk> because I even helped lions see the pen from far.
I don't love myself <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so that they believed it was close to the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  they came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So they jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn on and shut out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood in the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and he asked me if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a very much.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also being used to take elephants off farms.
And because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> University, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a boy in the meadows of the <unk> <unk> cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes flying airplanes and told me that someday it would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to a aviation engineer and a pilot when she grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture the exciting thing that is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical invention.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know it's already invented electrical fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I would have done it once, right? And I'm going to say, <unk> I've tried it before, but I've got a <unk>  CA: <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> at every step that I'm going to raise my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, are enemies.
Although I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought that I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed in a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street holding a child holding into her arms watching his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine left to North Korea in the middle of the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during starvation and only a few people survived grass, insects and <unk>
They also made more and more prevalent the energy cuts -- all around me was completely dark at night, except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture from North Korea at the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, they see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how we come from North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with kin.
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as refugee camp.
But I suddenly learned that it's not only hard, but it also dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to an awful destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was terrified of the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official told another one, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though there were <unk> there were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
But I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to make a solution going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what I expected to.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a huge gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call a pride of mine.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent to my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all of them.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I made everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in a short prison distance from the South Korea.
I was going and came in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family out.
But I didn't have enough money to pay less bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would want to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I read it with my whole heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The gentle unknown, a new hope for me and for the village to be able to get more about it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers, and the support of the international community are really the denial that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea.
But achieve its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they entered a new country, they start with some money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in touch with family relatives still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of aid and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Asia.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of fast food, fast <unk>
So the city planners come together, and they thought, let's change the name of the South Geographic to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles as if this is actually <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> food, fast <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a desert desert, Los Center, home from the food places to carry and eat in the car.
The funny thing is, the places of food to bring more people out of food in the car.
People are dying of debilitating diseases in Los Center in Los Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, Beverly <unk> it's like 15 miles away.
I was trying to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I look at <unk> wheels and sold as cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a forest of food in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided it should be.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we put together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine full vegetables you know.
What we do, we are a kind of group paid by <unk> from all the <unk> from all over the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city went on to me, and I got a <unk> by saying that I had to take my yard, <unk> <unk> made it <unk>
And I was saying, "Come on, right?
A court court for plant food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That equals 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million animal plants.
Why the hell don't it seem good about this?
You get a plant to give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Asia.
I grew up there. I would get my kids there.
I was pleased to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Like an artist <unk> who <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if you let it leave your canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that's a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an educational tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how they affect children.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
And I remember once a mother came and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my backyard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people that I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people will go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God don't, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to play it, but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant his mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had a couple of 50 people who come from, they work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids cultivate <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if nothing of this would be told if you're not taught how food is affecting your mind and body, eat blind what you put on front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that you are caught. I see the color kids that are on this way that they would have been designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids that are being moved from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You might probably produce the next George Washington Post.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we're never going to do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> to make them healthy.
I don't love me.
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to try and work to people, get the kids out of the street who know joy, and pride and honor to grow their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You get them to take your <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit on a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me when this is a road with me that this is a beautiful.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that you can have <unk>
And especially if you're <unk> in your bike and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, you would want a <unk>
The solution to that is to do highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and the water can pass through it, so much water water will flow sideways and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water never else.
The noise also will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that it can be <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones on the surface are going out.
First of all, a stone, then then and more and more and more, and so on, and you say, well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage comes into this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the birth of light, this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> and they will be thrown out of the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you take you <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use it to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is they heat the steel -- melt the <unk> the <unk> will flow through these <unk> and the stones would go back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show, which I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road <unk> 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do an <unk> test to prove this material.
So that was what we did in there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this will last several years without any harm.
We took lots of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made aging samples, put the samples, put a lot of burden on them, and then we took them with our <unk> machine, and we took them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the lives of the road, you can even double the life of the road, you can actually double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, it has to cool first before I can show you how the acts of it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> at my house.
My father was listening to the BBC who was listening to her little gray radio, in his small gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban laughed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could get them out of it.
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags to look like they were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
All of us knew that we had our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but even so, school was where we wanted to be.
I was so lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. Tell me that his daughter, my mother, my mother, went to school and so her father hated it.
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, only to convert our home school home to girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated about our life and she was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can get your home home for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So, you still want to do not <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find this proud to graduate in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the bravery to educate her daughters, it was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I took it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why you know, <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friend, <unk> for them, despite them even in front of a opposition opposition to it.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get home, they're the phone, a voice had noticed that if I was still sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old <unk>
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and what it sees is that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school on the school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It turns out that these changes would not last a lot, after the retirement U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who were going to go through them -- I see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities, and every day the girls of <unk> would give me it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk>
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They have spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, are carrying billboards and dignity and social justice.
You have shown a bravery <unk> to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west up to the south.
Finally, after a six months of brutal war and some losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with many other women, reconstruct the civil society <unk> <unk> a inclusive transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation of democracy and <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, counseling <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was becoming more and more <unk> than <unk> from selfish rights policies.
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, recently the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador.
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and its dog rapes of the human rights of prisoners and their lack of law.
Our society, made up a <unk> mentality, and it's <unk> more, and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to <unk> with our history of success to <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choice didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men like women?
Perhaps what they missed was not only women, but the other female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than it needed the election, that only will be <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs the female representation of the female more than needing the representation of <unk> and used to it.
We need to stop acting as agents of an outrage and call it to anger.
We need to start to act as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not just <unk> but it can also put <unk> instead of <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, spread through war, desperately desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before it made it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions that have the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans the entire humanity, of men and women, which all tribes and all the tribes have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> which grows inside the very divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of existence.
This is what you say, "My mercy is going all the things."
This is what we say, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That all of us will tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a ridiculous question that has an equally equally controversial response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the question that they all do the usual question: Why are she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I was just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I would join her head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anybody in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. <unk> <unk> where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I am <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of the religions, all the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only going on in <unk> <unk> <unk> relationships or <unk> -- in other families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who was going to sit with a man who would stick it up, and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be the victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and the more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year for partners, and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy Bronx feet.
I was sitting next to the subway in New York City and started with me with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had had recently graduated from a university from the <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
I had some great <unk> as apples, and a <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me, which was list, that I had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and quit my work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your mate, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering the head on a physical <unk> and financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where they come into the scene of those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so sure you bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived smaller.
I needed them to feel sure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life already was serious about <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, put it out of my girlfriend of my mother and married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we live happy forever, because I loved him, and he loved me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had a lot of sense that there was a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they had a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never make any harm.
I spent twice more on our moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would <unk> several times against the <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back out of our hands of honey -- he would spread through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some time in their life, and the Disease Control report that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had really good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help me to deal with his <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't they just do not <unk>
Why don't I tell me, I could have gone anywhere.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have to us, the victims, we know something that normally you are <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has been able to end the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include isolation, even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not going on?
I was able to go, because of one last beat up, I'd beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if it would have been allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told them all over the world -- to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family to full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you would love me.
We have the tendency to respond to victims as headlines as headlines -- <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> agreed on men who want to be <unk>
But since I published <unk> I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also learned that they learned that they learned what happened to them and that restore their lives joyful lives and happy lives of completely free and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I got married with a cute little man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is ever going to have more -- you would ever have a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head of someone who says he wants.
At this moment, the same thing is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid you do, but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, to his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my mad love on my particular love.
And I'm still doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> matter just in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims need all the world.
We need each of you understands the secrets of domestic violence.
I would have the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers of work, their friends and family.
They take their view of survivors as fantastic and amazing people that have a <unk> future.
They take the signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the visual oasis.
Thank you.
Hello. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that right now there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like this,  luckily, I've brought my clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothes on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
So if some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I would find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to get this sweater on the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I took my mind.
All right.
Why did I do that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but they also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would put your back and make her <unk> hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like what I did two days ago for the work, there are very little days to be able to transform our minds, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave it means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how are you going to be a role model?
And I always say, a <unk> was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what is this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have this associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I have known to use to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there's some of you guys who are <unk> Hold on. Hold there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people are always doing is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, didn't take care of that.
But then, what I would really say to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and a poet, which would be impressive, because you were the first time.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> head of the U.S. magazine or the CEO executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say older you want to be a model that's like saying you want to make the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate all of the things that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike surgery surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have taken your studies, and you have a copy and you have a copy and some work to your backs, no matter what you want, you know, if you <unk> that you want to be president of the United States, but your machine: <unk> Model underwear for 10 years, people will look at you very rare.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was excited about, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know that we are entering the ground, but it was a child.
This is what it looked like to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a party <unk> a few days before the photos of the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is this: <unk> things for free?
I have too many years of 20 inches and I never use, except the previous couple of them, but the privileges I get these are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and of course <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for being able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges because of my look, not what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their mind whether no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of teenage girls who were treated and 86 percent were black and Latino <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only young black and Latino young black people in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It is how many times I get <unk> And so on.
As I did research for this talk, I learned that to 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to <unk> percent of the 17.
So the last question that people do is, how is the life of a business model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer maybe that maybe you get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, clever people.
And all of that is true, but it's just part of what it happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my mind every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a little bit thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs and the more bright hair and clothes more in fashion -- but probably the women physically <unk>
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender and gender situation when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to be held out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was great enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos, and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no directors of <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum <unk>
In fact, most of them took them to random tourists.
My story starts in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter at the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you <unk> to New York at a <unk> trip and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to take us out of it.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
At the time, we were not aware of how much life it would change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This is a picture of weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old girl I could understand.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always get the same picture, the perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes, and how to perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something that we expect in illusion all the year.
Recently, on one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the Lego store that <unk> in the previous visits of the <unk>
And it described to me what I had to do about five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that remembered its heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we think are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participate in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes out of the picture.
I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't go back to somebody and ask him, get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special set of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk>
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs -- as characters were stupid stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, laughter applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't keep the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There is the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species -- 11 and 11 sides of the risk of extinction.
So why <unk> are important -- first of all, provide vital services vital services.
It's our natural garbage <unk>
They hold the carcasses to bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria help to absorb the anthrax -- that not to be by them would stretch and cause huge losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the UN and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the verge of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are the victims of this.
In South Asia, in South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, that means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey by livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India, and they've taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time bomb, the number of anger of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut it to birds.
They're <unk>
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so it will focus on a domestic problem, it's not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciate the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can they help? It can become assets, making noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you're going to tell you about the <unk> but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on their neighbors.
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do -- and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I don't am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything that we did, I would get it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people to grow food.
So we got with <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local <unk> grow tomatoes and <unk> and ...
And of course, people weren't really interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't make them work, and we were so sure that we were in so fertile valley, they hadn't had for agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not going to do anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here --  <unk> to save the people of Zambia from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
So we got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a much would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe that, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were nice and <unk> and red, at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture there."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought we only had Italians -- mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, they did, what they did, what they did and then see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You would look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that they would give you to <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the harm that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I treat all of the different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for mostly economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to respond to the age of 27 years, and I invented the people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never come to anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the locals who have a dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? They are <unk>
It will never come into a community with an idea, and sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We went together in a cafe.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figured out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not do not, for once, but not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with your community <unk>
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity has <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
To the smartest people in your community, you don't even know it, because they don't go close to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work for one, and we work on face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor in business, who sets up with you at his house at the table in your kitchen table, and he helps to find the resources to transform your passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see me, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business of the corporate spirit.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer your privacy, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you can get it to mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What about you have <unk> more this tomorrow?
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils -- <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we have <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a wonderful story that was in common magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came together with this group of people, and I would talk about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve, and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million of horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> generic companies called <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few hours, <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you."
In other ways, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer absolute absolute <unk>
And then later you have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell is that you have to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, to sell for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have looked and looked at the 100 icons of the Carnegie world, <unk> Company, Ford -- all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, just one: No one was started for one person.
The word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in <unk> along with their dedicated dedicated dedicated to you, what would you do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> someone who is talking about to you, what will it take?
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't spend a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> and <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for the cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> who gives <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always coming to the music.  There's a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful bacteria in the world, but also one with the most beautiful amount of American properties.
I live close to this house and I thought how it could turn it into a very nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved it.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this was a profound amount of gratitude for the living time and so on.
He gave clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I was able to keep this look in my daily lives.
I think it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take an <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk>  Before they die -- I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die -- I want to <unk> it again.
Before I died, I want to go to the <unk>
Before he died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me <unk> in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving <unk> and <unk> and remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the inner center we did a kit and now has been made walls of all over the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions at increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
And if you think about death -- we will bring our life.
Our spaces can reflect on what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
We don't speak, but you sell joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious <unk> and notice this is never <unk>
When they sing the songs of our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even remember it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
We sell the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that every single songs came out of my iPod, conversation that we kept when I was four years old, getting her arm for the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them to <unk> that could only mean one thing: They were <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, and sometimes to the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that will be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism, and although it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
It was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new thing to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it becomes more different, and the differences became more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature of pure nature and innocent a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard times in my family, times when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact that it doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could go through it, one thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, I would have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that they <unk> They're a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for weather, progress and change dies at the moment that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been going to be <unk> in the country.
Penn State State was asked to me, a trained teacher to give a kind of communication in engineering.
I was scared.  It was actually <unk> of these students with their great minds, and their big books and their big books and unknown words.
But as those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students with the students to me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care and health care -- and if we don't know what we don't know about this, the work isn't done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and so what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that we study the <unk> but that we study <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, careful with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
One of the things to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies -- they are ways to hook and <unk> with their content.
And when I present his work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you been wondering why they are called <unk>  What do the <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but that you support too much in the language area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower, it.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the audience can understand whether you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that are attached to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key to help everybody else open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire United States of <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor at the 19th century that he defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you're looking for a public charge without any <unk> platform, platform or principle, and that, when he won, he gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something about the words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that they were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the freaky name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He was thrown in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's true.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced to all kinds of suggestions that there might be <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about quality.
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there could be <unk>
Everybody got tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the day for a poor <unk> and I would always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King if he did it or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it was only meant by <unk> that he would take a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "Well ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to be seriously as ridiculous and <unk> as <unk> of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, you know, the Senate would not survive.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> as a name of President.
President Barack Obama got lucky to keep there waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and what I want to tell you about is that the president of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads and <unk> the world's largest economy and a fleet of flying and <unk> and so on.
reality and history has endowed the title of <unk>
So in the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, look like, well, it was a uniqueness later then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate I won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they are now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
<unk> are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually really changes the words much more words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices talking about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive tools with primitive.
Like each other, I take a cheap firefly light bulb attached to his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that black hole on the ground.
She was <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met in a day before, who lost the control and fell into <unk>
As I talk to you today, these guys are in the depths of that hole at risk for their lives without paid or reward and, often, dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> at the G8 <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not to such a degree.
When we ended up talking to me, I was very sad, I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got choked up, the stomach and weeks later, flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
A few of them thought about my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of the most displaced amount of African people during the whole hand of slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer is about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50 thousand of us today.
However, today you can cause it to entire families by generations to 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates gains over <unk> billion per year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false promises for good education and better work to then find that they're forced to work without pay, in threat of violence, they can't escape.
Our slavery today is working on the <unk> the <unk> goods that have value, but those who produce are disposable disposable things.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and <unk> was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy, thrown out of <unk> interconnected, mechanically <unk> in their heads, until 18 to the time, and they take the blast furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 hours a day.
There was no bottle to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot in the way and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship that country.
I could put them into a worse situation that they already were.
I had to have to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for the liberation and he trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying rocks in a miles of <unk> terrain to trucks waiting down to the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids that put them away, and the kids put them into their heads with straps <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know they're slaves and work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
Do you have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> dropped completely their houses.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness I told me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It took me on a few <unk> and they took this dirty basement of faint light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather than a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they are local for forced prostitution, <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of that seven years -- are forced to rape customers and to help them buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
<unk> often suffer sexual abuse to their hands of their clients.
And standing in the <unk> I remember there is an acute <unk> fear -- and in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I <unk>
There was no doors for me.
There were no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery, even sex traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children sold every year as sexual slave
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often related to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the ground of silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of black is the father of the blue and the blue <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, being able to get out of this house someday and go somewhere else where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a look at a look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers -- some more young children, and it makes sense right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work on these posters in these boats in the lake, even though they didn't know how to swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with it that his little canoe was <unk>
It was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches of trees fell into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they were thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is treating the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were spending the latest networks, but they had been working from the one one of the time.
<unk> and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes possible.
Who will become because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their motorbikes and suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and he played the window.
We were asked to put it on a dirt road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would invite us out of the car, and asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then I signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that we put on the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put them into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in an clear, and we had a small mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children strapped to their backs, and while they were looking for gold, they were looking at <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweating.
I remember looking at his tired, tired, <unk> given that many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they were able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see to work on the least lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> I inherit the debt of the uncle as a slave in the mines.
When I met him, she had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg lesion that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it is forced to work at night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream to be released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it is this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony of them and we'll make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I happen to think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
So I hope these images will wake up a force in which you can see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns into a fire and that <unk> fire on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied mathematics and there is a peculiar problem for whom the management management.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I would try to try to explain what I do.
The dance is one of the most human.
We got the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably a certain <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, as bad as the same extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous dancer of ballet dancing.
Over the past few years has been made in the age of treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we actually have an objective of an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement that are not biological markers, and so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of the clinical trials, they never do it.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic -- what if patients could do the test themselves.
It doesn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to think about is how not conventional ways to try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string ropes here.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds when you talk about it, we can imagine as dancers from a <unk> ballet because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes for example.
And as they did it, it requires extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it affects the <unk> organs.
On the plot below, you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of string ropes ...
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but the testing tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something happened to be so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to <unk>
We can reduce sleep difficulties from patients.
You would not need to go to the clinic for routine.
With high-speed monitoring we could get goals.
We could do a massive <unk> mass cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we can take the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines accessible to 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call at low price and take recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached 6 percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So then we <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What would you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease -- TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> They may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the confusion factors for the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of precision at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> have done a fantastic job and now has been shown that works on the mobile phone network as well, which is going on the project, and we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We were getting into the dark, in the darkness, in rooms and by the general, we avoid the sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect -- we make the impossible possible, and we were going to focus on the press all the time, but some of us are actually really artists with a lot of experience with many years of experience and a real kind of true of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Soon time later, an organization where he was voluntary -- there was <unk> <unk> in the place working as part of the response team.
And I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water had reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
It draws rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the mud and we left the houses that are <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and loved us.
For weeks, both volunteers like their neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and cards.
Everyone did the same.
They <unk> and bring them to different places in the villages of around them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those photos represented a huge part of the personal losses that these people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean the harsh bathrooms -- the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
They took them and I had the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't even beyond my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them who had a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help and think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night, I entered Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive and that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the appearance of her itself, and that would be as tragic as he had the <unk> photograph.
Over the time of time, they came by hopefully more pictures, and it took more <unk> so it went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would <unk> a village neighbor to Northern <unk>
Once a week we used our MRI scanner in the temporal libraries that were <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent of course from the photos.
It could be an hour. I could get a few weeks old.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand using the areas whose color and detail the water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> it <unk> covered from bacteria, covered from bacteria, even with oil -- all of it with the time over time with my time I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean clean, dry and would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We tell the guide to a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more pictures already <unk>
As he said once <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought these photos was kind of kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had started <unk> herself but stopped when you realize it even further.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images from their husband and their own face would not have <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and put it on the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos at a fire station between the rubble far away from where their house used to be their house, but their colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know they were all survived.
The day I gave him his photos his son at the lower age of 14.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could get on it, something that he could come back to look at, something that I could remember from the past that wasn't marked up on that day from March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers were attached to them -- hundreds of them helped us clean out more than <unk> -- <unk> photographs -- the big <unk> -- the great majority came to their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families -- hundreds of completely <unk> photos and <unk>
For this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 and material and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one of all, a relationship, someone loved you.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to you, but the first thing that we would look at looking for.
On this point was the project to restore small bits of humanity, from bringing someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, makes a huge difference in the life of the person that you're given.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected it with something bigger and something bigger -- again, using their talent for something that is not thin underwater models.
To end up I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent it Cindy day that I came back from Japan after six months.
While I could not stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me, because a similar picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> were inspired by and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that cuts through an apple exhibition by just one millionth of a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create a slow <unk> videos of light into movement.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they are really <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and I would switch it and put it into a second or a second or a second, in various <unk> create a photo pack.
And that package of photons, that <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a bullet bullet made.
If you take that bullet and this set of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you remove those photons inside of this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light moving.
Coca-Cola doesn't take this research.  <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons of photons that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes on the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if you take a common and common bullet and we make it run the same distance and you see it in slow motion, about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to see that movie?
One day?
It would be a very boring film --  from a slow movement in motion.
What about testing with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato wall and the wall in the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full <unk>
But if you look at more and more that tomato will realize that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> it's still bright. They don't have <unk>
Why? Because the tomato sauce is <unk> and the light bounces inside its inside and it goes back after several <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, they will be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera in MIT?
As a photographers, you know, if we take a photo to a low exhibition, it enters very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than <unk> <unk> so we will barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that bag of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these raw data and make it very interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, a piece is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where could we extract those multiple sets of light.
It's not science that we've already built.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons and I go back to the camera, but interestingly, it's slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique.
It has very good time resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what dot corresponds to what extent it is.
When you project a laser you can record a photograph, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, we will <unk> them and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it in a <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the curve, to the curve, to get around the curve, to the curve, to it.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is pretty hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of thinking about the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, made science in art, an art of photography in it.
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collected every time are not just for scientific breakthroughs.
It creates a new form of a computer photograph with slow and color code.
And let's look at those waves, remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a funny thing here.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are put out of us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes comes into the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime for humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, and you can bring it to <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were going to look for a change, they had a phone in the pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, you know?
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. You all have a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about my phone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 degrees lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every domestic telephone company, every single <unk> Internet provider has to store a whole range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or its Internet <unk>
And all of Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the Berlin streets and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of the people said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked her once, and I went back to him, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information, because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a lawsuit for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we'll not give you this information.
At the end, I got a deal.
Do you demand for demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars of information.
I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can zoom in, and let go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> on <unk> and what often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other and what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who sends an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile in my pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The Berlin Wall was probably never happened.
And as a result, neither every single <unk>
Because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they return home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value and it's not done in fashion.
When you go home to go home to your representative who just because business agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I put my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we have <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, even though they are.
It just happens by accidents, as the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you in this present one.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled
We go for a walk.
<unk> are at the mall, they are at the shopping mall, drive in circles and looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places to disabled places.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There is a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am in Park, <unk> in New Jersey.
I always love that my neighborhood and my disease had the same starting again.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York City.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in somebody's <unk>
The mantra of my father was: "Can you <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters older than my three sisters.
If my three sisters were going to the public school, my parents <unk> the school system and <unk> that I was also out of it, and if we didn't take away all the ultimate note all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another advance that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking like a boxer <unk> who has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk>
The people that I grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live in three months without eating three months without eating, so <unk> at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so that sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend on summer vacation on the front coast, I was not going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid if not to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would stay in <unk>
In summer delivery often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> I would put them hot cups on the back, I sat down in the <unk> Sea, and I remember that the water would be shocked by the eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can turn it into your head.
My parents would get this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the Department of theater.
All I would love with.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the peak note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> too slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> I would have a <unk>
I have learned <unk>
At the end of it, they <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying down, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asking her why and she told me that he couldn't make the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role in which it literally had been born and gave it to an actor.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
And I went back home, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend, <unk> in a <unk>
And in return, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't look more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> actors not white, with them.
And just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took a famous book from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell in the realization that he was at high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs around the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no <unk> and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to claim the first place, but I know they never heard that little nasty rumor that says women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arab are not <unk>
<unk> in the Arab was much easier than fighting the challenge against <unk> disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went as invited to the news program on the back of Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I went to a graduate school, I would join a study and sat in a <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the <unk> desk not to go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not come back.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but she was kind of <unk> and hit my chair.
A funny thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says kids are <unk> but he never was <unk> from me and a little girl and older people.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
We were online online clips with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite -- I'm going to be a terrorist.
What does it have?
We really should pray for it.
A reviewer suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make somebody in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- yeah, <unk> man.
The <unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying they didn't say, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with media, but I don't think it will be.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet by the <unk> <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in terms of a large state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee kids a few monsters.
It was the only time my father watched me act live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small town of <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and on the edge of <unk>
No for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no longer than future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
So after maybe a year is <unk> nothing.
One day he got a man who offers her to <unk> over for dinner, to dinner, to <unk>
He knows a group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home.
They present to a young man.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts into a bomb.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a connected organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a young boy from a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him.
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, hoping for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled out of what we call <unk> <unk>
And your story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> unemployed urban young urban urban <unk> riots.
For young people, the promise of town, the great dream of city is the opportunity, for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them the opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to the violence -- will be the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders in a business rate.
They were going to go back to a few juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had the rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> it was <unk>
There were no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a college graduate graduate college for Al <unk> for <unk> and other terrorist organizations, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have been destroyed the traffic system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
She started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who were normally able to <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time going to hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the spirit of corporate spirit, and I think <unk> spirit can be the most powerful tool in the <unk>
It teaches young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so hard.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business enterprise.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic since abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> that according to he said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it began with flowers for weddings, creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the <unk> presence.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO and working for the government, but their story, it really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk>
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
They put business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit -- is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and put out of their business.
They go to young people with the resources that they need to need -- <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, the spirit <unk> is something else to start a business.
It is to create a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park <unk> this is how it calls it when it's called, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
I hired kids out of the street to help rent and keep the motorbikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is: to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks <unk> which <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> <unk> area in the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we can almost pretend that we were the first human beings on the ground on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with view of a beautiful lake.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with an apple hearts -- <unk> balls of paper.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to take out what they thought they were going to be going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and he got a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where we were going to go through the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> and the Department of <unk> are about 11 tons of waste -- and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and I walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more a way to go a lot.
So I started to work like garbage <unk>
Now I wasn't just going to travel in the trucks.
And <unk> the mechanical mechanical and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asked about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as pervasive as you believe it, and in the days that it's very loud -- very quickly.
It costs a lot of use to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still keeping weight into the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of memes, <unk> waste is one of the ten <unk> most dangerous <unk> and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and they pass around all around you.
They just want to be <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a <unk> or circulation.
It's always got to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the waste <unk> are the most important work of work on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective to public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the waste of the efficient and effective form every day, this begins to get rid of their <unk> and their dangers inherent are threaten us in very real ways.
We have been controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the engines of economics start to fail when it's in danger by the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out his relationship.
And then there is what I call our daily speed that you need.
And so I mean simply at the speed where we used to move into <unk>
We don't usually care about it, and we were not allowed to grow or then we took our coffee cup or our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that is taken out of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the garbage collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, in a <unk> way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you live."
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that they keep with us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I listened to the <unk> of a garbage truck on the street, I grabbed my little son and I got the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing it all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I started to research the garbage collection and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist in this planet as we should include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste is what we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming a part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
I brought up two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emergent countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After some of these buildings there are many of the buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> skin generates heat inside the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it is a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And third, it looks like nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a shame that's so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually enchanted with the ancient market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a little bit of a <unk> building, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to <unk> the site, which is located in a very long area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we created a connection between these two streets, uniting all the entries from the building.
And this spreads with an <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that will spread in the shape of the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to local climate conditions.
And I started to think about a tissue similar to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air air, and also from the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of the fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center.
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because ultimately there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but it was also not necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which is collected water for the inner <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a teacher of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project -- the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors connected by straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was expanded the streets and create 12 initial blocks similar in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we selected some of the strategic points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell cell project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural knowledge.
So you get a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk>
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And they also respond to local standards that set up greater density at higher levels and a lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as given to the community in the space that the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and <unk> and do such things like run a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and the local economies at the same pace that the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal connecting nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable as you see all the new girls.
He had a huge amount of hair, very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> so it was very strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I would make my own plan.
I was a day after the school coming out of school. It was a little late afternoon, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> I went into the classroom, I took out of the school table -- I took the prayer book.
And then, I did.
I put up the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some of them.
All the way --  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other fellow partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> I would bring notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows of <unk> and I have a row from this way, just because of being there, because I was going to go.
I'm still surprising what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good about it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk> obvious stuff.
I would never be <unk>
But above all, I would tell you the reason why I was disturbing that this little little girl, so small -- was so good for <unk>
I was telling the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. Birds birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration of the sadness.
And so, you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that we study <unk> in all its possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I would not have <unk> <unk> or <unk>
There would be no king <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I put the lists of reading <unk> because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
However, there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost that they have all of them.
This year we have a hundred years of their masterpiece, "In search of time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as a cat <unk>
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, the jealousy, that you get down to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get too close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel logically, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in and <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details <unk> to <unk> the knife -- right?
The <unk> make all of all <unk> <unk> and that is something that I thought I'd understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure -- maybe right now."
And it starts to say to itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm cool <unk> that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in her private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like the large quantities of bright hair and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why we're so successful --  -- <unk> <unk> the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his toes, of jealousy, soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research on real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> are looking at <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are looking for knowledge, looking at the truth, a real painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful truth, the best.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways of <unk>
He says, "A woman to whom we need, who makes us suffer, causes us a much deeper sense of feelings and vital feelings that a man who can be <unk>
We're telling us we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion we will tell us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
You have some other emotion that teaches us to look at so <unk>
Freud write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that her wife would be <unk>
And Freud said that there was some strange thing in that man, who didn't bother what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> described very well how the <unk> are doing to <unk> but not accurately.
In fact, the most intensely <unk> the more we are becoming residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal acts of it.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years, I'm going to get it, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
One woman from 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since he would deliver <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to say, when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even though we get creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> <unk> <unk> books that deal with how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to <unk> and to <unk> from what once <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, you take your rings, cow bank bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
The novels shows you <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when you're in to a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers you.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each one of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to put your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> rushed in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated like a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, it allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get away from the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have fiction to <unk>
There is only fiction fiction.
<unk> used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, in 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and landed on the Aral Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the gray gray gray was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the highest lived in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo did work to about 400,000 people and asked about a collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They were killed, including Apollo crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which he proved after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 years later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the British words at Rice University at <unk> University of <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn into our goal?
And you might also ask, why scale the most <unk>
About 35 years ago, why would fly over the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the east of the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the preparation of the powers of technology.
It was because it was a great power to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we could not go faster than a horse or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew crew flew to 40,000 miles right?
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> when you see that problems we imagined technology would be solved as going to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure the cancer, or to feed the world population.
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the escape tube <unk> that Saturn Saturn rocket.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was absolutely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that didn't happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It looks like if the technologists had found us <unk> and they had enriched toys, things like <unk> and social media, or algorithms that speed the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't know the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley Silicon Valley, which have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years where they are <unk> at Intel at Intel <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, and concrete, the incentives that the venture capitalists are offering entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment caused that the creation of <unk> ideas caused by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investments, investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and developing capital is in the long term. They also have never invested in development of technologies dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we chose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you can.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is entirely economic <unk>
Coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternatives that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to the political and international treaties to develop the development of an energetic energy, <unk> a significant rise in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see a global energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and deal of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president and Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found out that there are many types of cancer, some exceedingly resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and must, but these four elements have been able to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to fix the problem, the institutions should be able to support the problem, and the institutions must support the <unk> it must really be a <unk> problem.
The mission <unk> which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it holds with the bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science -- like exploring the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon turned out to be straightforward.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start talking about <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a <unk> there's been a very large decrease of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should restore trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task has been poorly <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn to think that there may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that it might have increased in others.
I don't have that.
But I can turn to the polls of view, and the polls of opinion are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the polls of opinion over time, there's no many evidence of it.
That is to say, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still have quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway back.
But is this evidence for enough?
What facial opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you're looking at are the <unk> attitudes, that people face when they ask some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk> teachers.
I probably would say to say, "To do what?"
And that would be a very controversial answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel like a certain kind of <unk> official or a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, to say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give in the type of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about the confidence <unk> when we think about trust form.
I think these surveys are really bad tools to measure the real confidence level of trust, because they try to embrace the good judgment of the fact that you trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who are saving their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you see it, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters is that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in commodities and is responsible for and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the other hand, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are naive, and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can make certain things, but I see that they would take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're trying to do to do before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
So that's what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of organizations and <unk> officials and so forth, that made us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, you will see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that will attend <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we would think that the system of accountability is destined to ensure that we will guarantee that we are going to ensure that we are doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
They put all of that through the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to be worthy of confidence and <unk> to the people who are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy -- it's the trial, simple, simple actions -- which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
They put the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if you are two people together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of the people, all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to be <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is a day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple example.
The store where I bought my socks to say I can <unk> without giving a explanations for.
I took them and get me the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson at that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers of computers we have come together by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more and more, to such a bit of one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there were no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that takes place in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is transfers its physical body.
So designers can bring their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool is break down.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with digital information using all the skill of your hands?
In the Home <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They put a transparent pack with camera cameras to detect your fingers and face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, you can get to the inside of the 3D space, and grab directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in the real space, <unk> it's as easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can go through the book and try to pull lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there's the bottom of every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
What would the future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This magnet imam behaves like a pixel in 3D in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the motion by a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And to the digitally digitally <unk> the object will release of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and quickly and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality, the times that we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and, unlike the <unk> or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating about changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but start to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to be able to make ourselves our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was pleased to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed firmly that there was only an accurate path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera,
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera store.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were children, no authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing you could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved finding another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books going on here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about contemporary Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a huge <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but it's weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your <unk>
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this trap <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
They make a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed out of place because this is what students in China will learn.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research research as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading was working for research, why don't we do it in life in life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in the same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
<unk> <unk> are economic and policies and spiritual.
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of missing in translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I'm not going to go back to me or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books today that I'm here, happy living again with purpose, and clearly most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client from <unk>
I was a PhD student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
And Alex went into the first session using jeans and an <unk> Street threw into the couch of my office removed the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> like the first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy to just move my head while I would get the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> who said, Alex, and so I looked at her, she was right.
You start working on, and then she gets kids later, after death goes next.
For <unk> like Alex and I had <unk>
But shortly afterwards, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex that I'd talk about his <unk> life.
I would love me.
I said, "Sure, it's coming out of the guys underneath your category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> he said, "No no, but maybe he would fall with the next.
In addition, the best moment to work on Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> from Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of charismatic spin-off was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for race careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to age without passing before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take away the dream of a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be spent at 35 years.
That means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that give you a way to your life will have been past when you have 30 and <unk>
People in the top of 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be right, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we get.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than anywhere else in life and we know that the female fertility gets to the top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has a <unk> impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
newspapers talk about changes in the timeline of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence of <unk>
<unk> asked them <unk> names.
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think that happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years old to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, smart educated -- like you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't matter. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say that as I start a career before your 30, all <unk>
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy that day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My dating dates were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around 30, it turned out music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person who would be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but they don't care, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, to pick a mate, and you have two or three children in a much smaller time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's a research that starts to show, which is a lot harder and stressful doing everything in one time to <unk>
The average age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want right now.
<unk> you can't have the son that you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I'm sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I live a few very difficult ones, his previous life had been even harder.
I would often wake up in our <unk> but then she would wake up with the saying, "You didn't choose your family, but it can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the whole hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his own <unk> but then he was seeing the empty space that goes after the words -- "In <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he looked at me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give you <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not to be a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex with Alex as to just sit while the decade she was <unk> the front.
So, for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who would benefit from that identity crisis and design of identity.
For economic capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of the work, but I do know this: <unk> identity makes of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, <unk> exploration, the exploration that should not tell you, which is by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that I would explore jobs and to make it count.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds as opposed to who you know about, how do you think about how you know how to think about, how they think, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half is not, and the weak links are the way we can <unk> this group.
Half of the work has never been <unk> so I know the head of your neighbor is the way we get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you didn't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when you have a partner and form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose her family had arrived.
Maybe you think that 30 is better at all, to sit on my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choose the person you live in, or you're going to tell you now when all of Facebook begin to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best moment to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so <unk> in love as you're in the workplace.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with whoever the ones are telling you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin of a cousin who was working in an art museum in another country.
This weak <unk> helped him get a work there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
He's married with a man who chose <unk>
I read his new career, he loves her new family, and I sent to a letter that said, "Now the space of emergency contacts are not sufficiently enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out from the airport in Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, or even the <unk> -- a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years, or even in the next generations, or even in the next generations, or even in the next generations, or even in the next generations, you can even see the next generations in the next few years.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity and get your identity, use their <unk> choose your family.
They don't get to define what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very difficult job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh grade students in New York schools.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I do tasks.
When the work came out, I was grades.
What struck me is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance had no I.Q. <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be so good.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, secure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After several years later, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure better ways.
Is it <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would be, as far as possible in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in slums.
We partnered with private companies, asking myself, which of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
and who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts emerged in a feature like an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good looking, the physical health and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years, and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination made significantly greater chance of <unk> even though the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing the children when they were at school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National National <unk> which matters <unk> also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little bit that we know, how little it knows science about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we design that in children?
What should I do to teach kids a really robust job of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  And I know that talent doesn't give them any purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the attractive is commonly related to or is even related to the talent measures.
Until now, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have for the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if you've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the Chinese shape.
From that moment, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic trust.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read of traffic signals from <unk> to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting down, <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> -- this symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West.
I call <unk> at these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old guy, two are company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> this <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a writer, just like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart on the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker is pretty an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two forms together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a board on the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is leaving hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've been in almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land.
This is a sun packed with the beginning, because Japan is the east of China.
So a sun along the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two piles stacked over the other.
In ancient China, it meant in exile, because Chinese Chinese <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora have become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film <unk> its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of complex <unk> of child fantasy show.
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took over 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> to a girl dressed as an enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician do it today, the magician would say, <unk> you are salvation of Oz like prophecy.
Do you make magical shoes to defeat the military generated by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the magician magician who was the most promising characters and people even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did "Star Wars" -- my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a kid.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had been <unk>  So, she was so slid in the room, and she was so impressed by a Mom as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what it was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, resilience and <unk>
I would have the feeling that Luke had an army to remove the government?
<unk> this with the magician <unk>
How do he win Dorothy in his movie?
In doing good <unk> with all of them and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, OK?
Why is there so so so much force it's so much driving in the movies for our children, and so little of the <unk> path.
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence from male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read as much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think that at the time of the first kiss. I really hoped that the cars were really expected to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search for finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and to stand at <unk> from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, guys, are not really their target audience.
They make a phenomenal work teaching girls how to defend themselves against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend ourselves from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all the time continues to appear in classic after classical, every single one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the two men and your son, or two men who raise a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic books, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a conversation with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to <unk> in the film, there are more than a female character having lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women are talking to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid than you like that?  All right?  Thank you.
Two women who exist and they talk about things among them.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> from <unk> success from <unk> a idea of what is a quality of quality.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think I <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the players to take a look at the door and say, "Come on to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go into the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular films how many people believe that they have artists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then is okay.
But there is a bigger number than this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what it would say.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What's <unk>
What do they not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then collect reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we expect that to <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was his favorite Star Star Wars <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than nobody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories than I tell my <unk> Go and struggle with just more stories where you see their work is join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people better and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine to Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would invite you to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized to do with my own eyes, not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a almost 1.3 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my sea eggs had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what led me to satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> in Egypt called <unk>
And the place of all, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant pink place.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes in the man-made landscape by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an old city city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge and measures approximately <unk> by <unk>
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try and see at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where we were going to get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very high area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing it <unk> they can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for skin <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
That means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> layer of several hundred years that date from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found the work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a workshop in <unk>
That might seem like it's not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, the jewelry, the jewelry, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer, of occupation of the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite days that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't even find <unk> here, but they will get to the place in a near future to <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Trade -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the land.
So according to TED it wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually happen in 1984 B.C. degrees in a lost city not for a lot of time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
And now I put a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> race and they're going to address their door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide from the door of your house.
There are bikes flying around everywhere, wheels that pass on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> <unk> the threshold of the gate, <unk>
In the lobby, or what there is on the other side of the door, and you look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair from his chair, on a brown.
It's a horse speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you know it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
In the room, and making a peak of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes and dancing over his middle center, singing <unk> I give <unk> One More <unk>
Now you will go to the kitchen.
The ground has coated with a yellow brick path and from the oven. They come up to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> them just once.
We were using the names of tens and tens of strangers.
They lost whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena from nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, "Well, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
All the ones who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques invented two thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that he used <unk> to memorize their speeches and memorize the medieval <unk>
And my reaction was: How do you not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant one, although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live, in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year in the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a <unk> problem that's awesome.
Someone tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went back in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties about writing about writing about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory <unk> disciplined and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in order to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed the cities and I would argue that they have changed our cognitive life.
We have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the latest places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined and disciplined and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there's <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group from memory, the lab.
They wanted to know, it has brains in some way, structural or <unk> or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subject of the subjects in control with the <unk>
When they put them into a functional MRI machine, <unk> your brains as they were <unk> numbers, faces and form of snow <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive <unk> is driving as an armed race where every year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times the memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> on <unk> <unk> that he's about to try and memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he had just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the technical techniques at the end are reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox. It says the following: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
So what would you do?
The person who was told that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually means nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> white <unk>
They have <unk>
They are good when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back two thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who was attending a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring it to a <unk> they would go to a <unk>
He stood up on foot, and he <unk> her memory poem and <unk> and so soon he was, the <unk> hall.
Let's go to everyone.
But it was not only killed all of them, but they ripped off the bodies.
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing out unique <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed her eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single point.
I took the family family <unk> where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What you have noticed at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or <unk> or instructions or a word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you let me tell you that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to tell you who you were sitting on the horse were sitting in your lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago, to the first of memory to the first memory of memory.
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory -- in the same way that he would have made it <unk> if they would have been invited by <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to say is that competition is completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the <unk> of <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is like <unk> speakers -- their narratives -- not word for a word -- which is going to confuse but, typical for typical.
In fact, the <unk> term comes from the Greek term, which means <unk>
It's an <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and at rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The first <unk> sentence would be like the first place in its memory palace would be.
I saw that this was just simply fascinating, and I packed up with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensively on this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing about is when someone walks in front of you.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
There are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought a marketplace of <unk>
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just training the memory.
What it is actually is about doing is getting better and more the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was really excited.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory competition.
It's a pair of <unk> and some <unk> covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year earlier. It had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good job for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so painful <unk> that work on.
Because they are based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete care that most of them are not going to be <unk>
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are made <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, that's what I would call the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> -- not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk on our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even think about processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we would get only a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from the board, I was a six years old, and I lived there at my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom. I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And, in between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time watching the TV, so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody noticed me, and every time I <unk> and I was wrapped up in a towel, all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
He <unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not about mathematics, but it's from those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we are.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under a roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture tells us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would love to think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it because we based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which is using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are going to deal with <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has this round thing, you have this round thing, columns, red brick -- that they leave <unk> which is trying to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, at the other side of the country, the second library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new new solutions to the forms of living lives.
We were able to push it and then we made so much away from the people.
All of the black, this <unk> you guys think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We have to go on the other side and connect to connect with these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we do swing the <unk> <unk> over and over and over again, we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we got into the '80s, and we started to incorporate these symbols.
I would add the <unk> to the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
And we started <unk> and we added bake bake to use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers -- that can be <unk> <unk>
The forms are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
One madness.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
And perhaps with a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started doing swing the <unk>
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new <unk> design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that would be involved against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when she was critical and public and public and public in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times journal, <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased in a mile when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and <unk> and <unk> how are it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms of culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing made the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if you had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium, country with other star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these little elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, it actually began to happen with all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
Architecture is everywhere right now; that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not quite accurate to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more, before knowing whether which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much of the <unk>
That will never come back to happen, because we're on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the elevator.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get to both extreme edges almost in <unk> and it will effectively make the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the architects, and you, you know, the public.
Now we can make <unk> symbols with emotional burden of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that they were <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished the building, it was part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like this, there was no surprises.
The building came to being part of the community -- that first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a communications medium, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you have made the building.
And as you use it to tell your history, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes you interact with collective memory, and when you carry these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other about what architecture we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no unique response to what it might be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words, and a complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience, who doesn't embrace anything I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the one is <unk> from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad term of red brick of red brick with ideas of what it should be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings would be attached to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage parking in Miami Beach, can also serve to make sport or for <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Side of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more friendly.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give them a way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this cool way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look in the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
She <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those great kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And I put all of your friends doing this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me thinking, "When did I want to do this?
How is that all of a sudden we're all going to look like our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for the Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, he only wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though her mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among what her mom tells him, and what his friends or fellow from school said, "You don't know who to believe.
So a video of her, he puts it on YouTube, and begs others please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talk about a normal and normal and normal and current, who receives these answers at one of the stages of their most vulnerable life of their life more vulnerable to the most vulnerable of their lives.
Thousands of people are publishing video like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to be doing this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time -- speaking, giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected, we have never been so connected, so we have so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of feedback that they do.
There's no division of life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the most important thing in somebody's life in front of what it's normal in a day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news stories right now.
<unk> It's zero to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the culture of popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids are also not immune to this.
Like the one of the superheroes of the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be safe individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we are teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and others start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as human beings and how to develop society and the labor of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the middle of class. They were engaging in the classroom debates because they don't want to call attention to their physical <unk>
One in five are not coming to class at all over the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the sports season, if you don't think you see good enough enough, specifically if you don't think you are thin, <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it comes regardless of what these young people actually weigh up.
So, in order to be well, of course, we're talking about how you look at you not how you are.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diets not healthy that they can bring them into a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we thought that is all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions, like <unk> and drug consumption -- we have aesthetic surgery, plus the old sex and no protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that <unk>
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways that we have to nurture trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs that are available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs that were very surprised -- not realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program are following our children not only will have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are really crucial points for anyone who would be willing to provide a education self-esteem that works.
An education is a fundamental one, but to tackle this problem requires each one of us to take development in the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenge the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the input, our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you put a <unk>
In summary, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow all their own people valuing their own person, valuing their individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making a difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they see that they have never seen the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who is your mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> Your <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is two seats. What would it mean for her if she was released from that voice <unk> in her interior, which was <unk> for not having a long legs, <unk> more <unk> a higher, feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this and we would say that they would have his potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are getting us all together.
But let's go back to our children the truth.
I think that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
They go to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> of a year of age, they will become agents of safe change.
So let's do it.
The <unk> of November 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially it was innocent as well, but being a prisoner of other young charges in the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans will spread through an FBI informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't escape them.
Later on, it would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a love mother, American mother, elementary school elementary school elementary school elementary school.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims are going to meet.
I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, though, in all of religion, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that you have to use all the possible means for everybody to live like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last week, he and some of my friends had been going to shoot at Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played my father my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained how to point the goal to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise all, especially of me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
Out of such father, such son.
To all of us, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a stick with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade <unk> Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved it from 20 times, that instability for my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody at the time of packing and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class as often as a victim of <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white <unk> but it will be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons we didn't have social skills, to say <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
<unk> <unk> judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put up my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I participated in the National National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group went into the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had been doing, friendship, was Jewish.
I took a number of days to go out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in this Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures -- that experience was critical to the development of my character.
All the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
I happened to have a chance to work with gay players there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics that I'd seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
By that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that of being homosexual but I know what is to be tested for something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
All evening, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and I would help me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes, inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with your eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough with endless enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside of it.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
I changed it when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone somewhere, who is going to try to take the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which even though I would join this violent ideology.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do that for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those <unk> acts as a rejection of my father's actions.
And with this simplicity I put up here as proof that violence is not true to any religion or race -- that your children don't have to follow the pathways of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
Right now, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking stream.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything.
This movie is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a personal movie of your own, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have a personal awareness.
I don't know that you are aware of you.
Consciousness is the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce results without having the movie <unk>
At this point, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is objective it.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective to <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would bring that vision.
Psychology is studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is studying the brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Bannister said, <unk> is the moment so that science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, an accretion of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this was fantastic. And it was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that I found Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or being happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experiences -- but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is answering some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a movie internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of these emergent behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they work -- how they work <unk> they adapt to adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and function of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we talk about how we play <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, it's the question of why all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that will work for a long time, hit me on the face against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms, that would work.
But at the end of the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we will get away at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains the biology part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of it.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> <unk> before you can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the human subjective movie includes sort of an illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and you study everything that needs the explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely pure awareness theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denial that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be described.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, the space and the mass.
<unk> laws of fundamental laws than <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of more basic stuff.
Instead, they are considered principles, and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of how fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century <unk> he discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space <unk> space -- mass law, and then <unk> the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws have been <unk>
I think that's the situation we have with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> space -- <unk> load, then by a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
That doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to make it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts of space, the space, the time, the physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a level of consciousness.
This view is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> in mind, every system is aware, not only humans, our dogs, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some level of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think like, "Oh, we're always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some <unk> <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy, for you.
How do you think about something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental like space, time and dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea is <unk> it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and very powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
All the information processing is information, there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
One very exciting thing is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration -- which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of information integration -- as much significant, level of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the Arctic microbes, the particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
<unk> a fundamental law of the high level of <unk> high level of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often noticed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the bottom.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that he puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to bring our relationship to nature, and it can have a fairly serious social and ethical consequence.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you're going to be hungry.
I think it tends to be thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated information processing -- so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you get all with some pretty serious ethical problems about the developmental ethic of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada, has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED talk, and at this point we have a TED awareness.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second is that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to figure out it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile -- a low amount of education.
I went to school, I joined my friends with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a terrible problem.
She didn't really get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under low profile in my father's <unk> and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What's a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching myself in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the class of 11 <unk> he raised her hand and said, "Hey, when will you go to your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things in school?"
Hopefully in the <unk> hall.
And then when I realized, this boy had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the question of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to go, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lying in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> A capital capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you fantastic give you exceptional.
It's not something wrong and doesn't make it exceptional.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without drawing with a pencil held out of the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we would take a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, I would encourage the disabled in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that people."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times the number of times that they've been approached by strange <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to the disabled people in the benefit of people with no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's make some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was excited by the so-called social model of <unk> that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those photos as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that the disability, makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "Oh my God, <unk> are not sometimes inspired by something.
Actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to put the mobile phone battery into the battery battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that would be <unk> and we will <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us a hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's a lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a load of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a TV screen will not get the <unk> to <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and we will make a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> from nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability to be <unk> by getting up from bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child from 11 grade in a high school in a high school in Mexico.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you can know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see reality <unk> and the professional football thing with <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to respond to one of those questions, so please, don't <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and at Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would fit with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is to run through the game field to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a young man of 110 pounds <unk> us trying to deal with all of their self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I put some videos to show you what it is to use the Google <unk> under the hull, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A few times.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice -- Mice Test <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality of ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why why, with this video video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! Don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a rollercoaster in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan of <unk> when you get a <unk> video crossing across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before and make a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be able to be <unk> running the ball to the bottom of the network?
What is your experience when you get out of a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get a <unk> for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve the reality of <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information about what people want to see and say, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it for winning <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> had been put in a <unk> to their <unk> of field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, more rapidly.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then on the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see your next big play in front of you, in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose matches as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> manual.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be like to have a camera in every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something in which you're already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have the information <unk>
This would be <unk> to good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team of computer will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field.
You get the ball and you go.
They put a <unk> <unk> all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will get you.
They go to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you get stuck.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we can, but the receptor sees in its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights and can modify the race.
It <unk> it takes the <unk> running the <unk> running and <unk>
The wonderful audience and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just as bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is, literally being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad is the actions of the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth of a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, like the usual of us.
Thank you.
Recently I got <unk> after 23 years of service on the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years I spent the country on the south end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden <unk>
And the bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known about its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most <unk> places.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who was building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from their openness, more of 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every single since he releases all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under their soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body bumps about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which would be living for vital organs.
Most of them die in an impact.
The ones who don't don't, they normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the one that <unk> this method of suicide will realize <unk> death than they were <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel in the bridge.
This is where most people have to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we were successful, that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who spent suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials and psychologists train the new government capital.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 Julius last year when I got a call from a possible suicide guy sitting in the wire near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I saw Jason talking to Jason talking to an officer.
Jason was only 32 years old and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to hurt him from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> he asked us if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
It was <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy kind of smart guy in New Jersey just had to get his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage of suicide affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone would be <unk>
What do you think?
What about that?
In my experience, not just to speak, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like this, because they probably didn't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask the question is, let's focus on similar circumstances have thought about ending your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they will never be <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and blessing who I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking it should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but seeing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to San Francisco to see the game of 49 percent with his father on the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of the <unk> and they <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and reported that the car car was down on the bridge.
One witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> at the end of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been bad without suffering from real mental illness.
It shouldn't be that easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I replied a radio call by a possible suicide sidewalk on the sidewalk near the bridge tower near the northern tower.
<unk> my bike.
When he looked at me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to his mind that day come back about that lane and give her life another chance.
When Kevin came back to it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he do that he did that he did that and gave me the hope and gave her the other <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "Can you <unk>
They left me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11 o'clock events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> by help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been correctly <unk>
I had Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, now we know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We do thank God for you.
I really, in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General at San Francisco that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Currently, Kevin is a <unk> father and member of the society.
It comes openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather gets <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, stealing of the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want your own <unk> pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved -- I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about an hour.
During that time, I would raise your hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that most of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second they leave on the side of the fence -- they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be hard to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and you know what you are, and how do you focus on that?
I should be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I felt that I had finally achieved the dream I'd had since a child.
My foreign exterior was finally driven by my inner truth, with me.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I refer to over later, when I look at this picture, I think, you got it, <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or because of the beliefs of the people around us.
They're people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, and I even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called revelation.
This is mine.
I had a <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this <unk>
And my mom was wondering, "Why would you always wear that shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but we now know that it's really a bit more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I would never let me share my story, not because I would think that being a bad thing, but why the world is treating those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mama, dad and a family who keeps me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in American culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I still wore a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night, she said, "Why haven't you've been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was responsible for the cost of <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won the bathroom, I won the <unk> and she was a third finalist between 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from Queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that I passed my request in the green card that I could go to live to the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you go to the United States you can change the name and your identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I put two <unk> to my name.
She was also obsessed with me when I fell into Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the rural cities in Thailand do do do perform more sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to have surgery before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked at <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> he lived his truth, but he <unk> her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 November, we make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood up in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living living alive and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so there are no longer than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> Sure. Yeah. First of all, thank you to thank all of my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and they told me that their parents couldn't take it. I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's only gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes you had not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, parents generally know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for the education defending his rights in 2007. And when he risked his efforts in 2011, by the <unk> the <unk> National Prize, which was made very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at human history, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, just from the beginning, when you're born a girl, his birth wouldn't be <unk>
It's not welcome for his father, not for her mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives his <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother would get a lot to have a little girl.
When gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother suffering, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays at home and school admits of the siblings.
Until age 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it goes into adolescence, when he was 13 years old, he passed away from her home without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It turns into the call of her father and her brothers and his brothers and her family, and if you break the code of that <unk> they could even kill.
And it's interesting that this source code of honor, not only about life of a <unk> also affects the life of male member of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of their life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more norm of societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who must be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and who accepts the decisions of his father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if it doesn't want to.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like whether or if he was <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the very young one, you have to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
I get brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like how newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so long before I came back, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half and a half years and a half years old.
You might wonder, why should I mention a little girl at a school?
Yeah, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in hunter-gatherer societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for life to life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
A campaign to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were looking at the <unk> form of <unk> and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give her sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to lie in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all of these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
I took my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
They taught students to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
They get <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of people's participation in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
Musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up through the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for his blog for the BBC, he was offered her to the New York documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and on October nine.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> in between life and death, I loved him, I heard my wife and "I have <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you <unk>
They both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would come up with a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe severe muscle pains, because his facial nerve is cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was shocked by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and my face.
I'm going to play good. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
We got brothers and sisters, we have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl <unk>
<unk> when you don't have a task.
You fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special about my mentoring who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I mean, you don't ask me what I did.
I did what I did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and, from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you move to a brain operation.
Are you still as smart or not?
Don't be like this, you will be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix in chemicals and try to keep them alive.
More than once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided I would be able to try and get the dose to try to get the <unk> dose, because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started trying to test different <unk> and I was shocked when you see how small changes in the dose we will dramatically understand my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and chemicals for a man of 1900s, and I was surprised when I saw my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen like that.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do, and since then I have better with men.
What it was trying to do is to deal with those hormones and those <unk> and so on, it was reclaim my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my creative flow of ideas.
I think almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of the key point -- how do I get these mental images I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were going to make them <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought about the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind works, to me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I have already lots and lots of great mental <unk> it really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use its imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used ecological technology, MRI image by functional MRI to represent the brain -- you can see the brain scanning made by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The middle of the medium shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. It looks like the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image, and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube YouTube while their brains would be able to create a big community of reactions in the brain in front of the video.
Then, I showed you a film with new images, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer, using just the scanning brain information of scanning <unk> to show what it looks like that the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're good about doing it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture, and when you imagine that same image, you can imagine in the brain the same <unk>
This was conducted with the brain scan systems of bigger resolution available today, and their resolution was generated as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I'm not giving me that one.
Many are proposing new techniques that are projection by imagery, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we have to ask ourselves, is this technology being the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but to this point, magnets more <unk> only provides small improvement on resolution -- not increases for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets we make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI was to do really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and guidance of FM or FM of FM systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field -- <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> into the electronic radio frequencies.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with patterns of processing radio processing patterns -- we can increase the massive form of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split up our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity.
We are going to be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly by the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the disease of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices than opening this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay court.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be to tell someone for the first time that he loves her or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other kind of conversation that you've ever done in life.
And I think I think it's a hard conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is a universal thing.
Day fear, and we don't like to happen.
So many years ago, I was working on the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk>
And I'll be slope that by the <unk> of my little <unk> and I got my head on my head, and I would ask myself a little kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit, would take me on my coffee with a <unk>
The father said, <unk> the newspaper, and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything about it, and we will go through it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and ten years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
An family silence but this time was prepared and he was about to come into the female issues at the table.  I had the <unk> of Betty <unk>
The Gloria <unk>
Even an excerpt from the "Vagina Monologues," which <unk>
And so I took a long breath, and I went down the look and my back and my backs of four year-old girl with a pink dress in my pink dress looking at what is not a <unk> <unk> one girl with a question: "You're a little girl or <unk>
So I took it down a lot, again, I set up <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and he looked at a child, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
All right, I'm more of the kind of <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite friend is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything. It's just like, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation to anyone who ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You only know how it feels like a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons about why out of my closet was more difficult to come out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared in bank bank to broken is more difficult than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I say is more difficult than telling your son of five years that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what we're hard to do, with respect to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse and a horse and a horse and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any child from four years that would go into the coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, she <unk> in a corner of my head, dark <unk> my <unk> <unk> and the moving one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers with the ones that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable men's launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of them were invited to know that it was gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and eventually got to a where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me was years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women rushed to <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and has never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our community Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing desperately her support, to make me know that he was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but you can <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
It's just like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in the coffee had no armor and I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be told, others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate its truth.
It would never be <unk> by that.
And some of them can come out of sure, <unk> for what they've done, but they're never obsessed with what they are.
And yeah, maybe some will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you meet in a dark <unk> <unk> <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very good, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let me step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth and the Earth of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives. So you can observe Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept of the Earth -- it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some moment in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet <unk> stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the understanding of the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through several disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that will solve the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic process, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and <unk> together, asked for a number of years, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force with a force of the power of potential future, accessible, yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain our choices open.
And so, having this equation, is natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce <unk> or <unk> in their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is <unk> a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from her?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy for long-term entropy in any system that can be found inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could go through multiple intelligence tests -- playing human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without that there would have been right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> and human assistance technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate just pulling opposite ends of one rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the <unk>
This ability to cooperation have interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see that we are going to be able to attract new connections into a social network where friends are constantly constantly getting away and maintaining the very connected network.
This same network of network capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> setting up the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend their reach from the world to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of actions, successfully increasing assets under their management <unk>
This ability to risk management will have massive applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive behaviors, such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back at the beginning of the use of the robot, <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you have smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, would have a <unk> rebellion, would have a <unk> rebellion, would have a <unk> rebellion, would have been a <unk> rebellion, in the front.
So the machines are attached to us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that general can actually emerge directly from taking the control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the arc of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting around other stars, which points to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go through them in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that comes to us.
Data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother star.
In together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of virtual worlds that will potentially benefit our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> year was the <unk> recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused to scale on global scale have <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a scientist at climate, and I'm not a <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet being influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet only discovered and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world showing this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The <unk> of <unk> like the <unk> mission, they take samples from the atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now give you not only short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images are reminded of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen filled with our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will get to a large and sad contribution to the implication, and the belief from some that Mars would expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is as to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for ocean exploration, and marine preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile areas and <unk> of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an experiment. <unk> paradox.
A lot of years ago, the Enrico physicist. Fermi later, having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to think about being living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we have <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization we will save us from ourselves, but marine preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put into the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed closed.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, one <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff <unk> to pass it up, because he had an flight early to Europe to the next morning, and <unk> from my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but certainly not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, I was very stuck.
I'm a profession a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I got to the counter counter in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, the systems that could put in your place, that you would think about bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen, the probability of being a total catastrophe happening.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winning the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective on me.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
They all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to find out all the things that might be wrong, and then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things about it or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so apparent.
I'm going to start with <unk>
At the house, it will be a place for the things that are very <unk>
This sounds like common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, where the fish are where the trees are going to be <unk> where tribes live in and live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find your nuts.
And if you ask whether someone really did the experiment, <unk> the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They weren't using the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys in the car, <unk>
So at home I would take a place for the keys, a hook onto the door, maybe a petri dish.
For your passport, a particular <unk>
For your reading, a <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with the cell phone, a picture of your credit card cards from a drive, passport, <unk> by mail to themselves so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain unleashes your brain.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful than when you face to a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one to be loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making, medical decisions, and in fact for social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from which would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So let's say they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, stroke brain.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that should be done then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to speak, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's to <unk> the numbers need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be able to have surgery in any medical procedure before it will help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's to blame someone, it's from scientists like me.
We have not very well understood.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number of people need to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help someone else's person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I have to explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why don't it not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for more more statistic and it's <unk> from the effects of <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> muscle pain.
But just a moment.
remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how you can take this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help you the drug to help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air at the value of the crash, but actually this number of necessary numbers is actually quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men from the top of 50, the prostate of prostate cancer, the number necessary to try and <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can argue about the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life out of pain, or a longer life that might have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator with a predator is not necessary for the <unk> system, or <unk> or immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, don't react very quickly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those feeling of stress is the rational idea thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown that.
So we have to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be in order to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at night in Montreal in Montreal when I returned from my journey, my contractor gave me a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key way of the front door to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree -- there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be <unk>
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the political system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French sign came over the decade in 1800, and with the time of the time, they mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language that we know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years old.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a real sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country -- tracking their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example.
"You don't know the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they don't <unk> the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag of what the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about what is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
Let's go ahead and go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, you can do it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to each other, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel this <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound property and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body body.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and care that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could be able to <unk>
I chose me to be surprised.
There's a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people that can support me equally and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when I ask for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan in a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to go with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express completely on the paper.
And the same can be said to a concept in <unk>
Two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signs of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano to get better understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into many different parameters <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so, as you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you can only get the piano at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in order to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If just a key shift would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is going to be <unk>
This is the signal <unk> on it."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you reading?
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you would take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun and you're wearing.
This is all day."
If you get it, and you throw it down, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes over time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> I think automatically I think automatically <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> yourself time."
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest -- but they transmit very different meanings here.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allowing <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to <unk> not that you have to hear to learn to learn the music.
<unk> is rich, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You know, "Can you <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because the adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the real truth.
When I was older, I found out that the adults also found out, and that they're not very good to clean the others.
The country country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk around the beach with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, he cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect these little bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats to use.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> job that children are very <unk> so that kids can be able to participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who provide electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it to the size we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to get them into something that we hope will work.
We decided that instead of plastic chunks of plastic, just information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get too much with robots.
Then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick at creating prototypes that ended up before lunch.
And to transform light bulbs and web cameras on accessories. And it <unk> it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating around through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in water.
<unk> this step step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would take it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to move immediately.
I'm going to research my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
You see the news, the Internet, the Internet, and you get distracted by this image:
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is going to be <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil also are brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be built through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the way back to other children.
I was looking at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it had several giant waves of giant <unk> and those <unk> destroyed, several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima a nuclear center close to the water.
And today, according to reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant of the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of <unk>
If we go on the west coast, we can measure the radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the majority of the time, it has safe and it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time, we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> parents didn't get it.
But every night I went to the center of the <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> their whole life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do afterwards, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So we were able to notice that the radioactive dust, they become <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition -- the closest to the nuclear center to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles away from the nuclear center, and with the <unk> aid <unk> we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit very small in the meantime, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we converted it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, we can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility population transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new vehicles <unk>
Oil plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect kids from the horrific truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen citizens, creators, <unk> we should prepare to the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- <unk> two very radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel, the other one of the silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic thing.
One puts on the environment, the other self believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble and saw a figure that was going to be free.
The <unk> was only by Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we carry all the information that required it for each cell to work and to work for it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least of the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and production product.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world made out of parts -- <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects like <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial balls are thin with <unk> pores
The skins of the back are more thick with small <unk>
You acts mostly like filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world <unk> the double personality of every designer and an architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the assembly and the growth between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, and synthesis, it shows you in the two screens after me.
My work, at the very simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and getting up to growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why was it not possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you have four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products and structures and tools and tools through scales, large scale -- like this robotic arm with a basis of 24 meters in diameter with a force base that one day not very far away to print <unk> buildings and graphics from the nanoscale made from genetically altered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the old Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> is unique to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion <unk> <unk> <unk> you're going <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This bike combined and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner.
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical and <unk> instruments that allows you to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair at the same time, comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern. It becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to other material or other <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious <unk> but when I was a young man, my grandmother was telling me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and to define a lot of what it matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, and branches, and <unk>
All of the tree was a <unk>
Instead, the earth made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made out of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design if the objects were made from a single part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we are looking for the material that is <unk> the kind of <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
In order to print large-scale structures at a large scale, it was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these <unk> structures from one material three long, 100 percent recyclable material.
When the pieces are ready, you stop it dry up to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which first showed up on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems with <unk> <unk> and if it remained even more, to window.
A <unk> tree, <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and put it on the floor, help grow a tree.
The fits for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for travel.
To do that, we must master bacteria and control its flow.
So as the <unk> table, we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- it will be filled with new biological cables inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
So let's take our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It becomes the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the <unk> tract to help us to <unk> these bacteria and to make their function out.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as the dominant functionality of the material.
If we wanted to be more <unk> they are more transparent stations.
This immune system <unk> when it comes from one end to another, it weighed 60 feet.
This is half of the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut intestine.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are just months months -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we would take our skin, <unk> the tissue harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
And so now, you know that a 3D printer actually prints out of layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't make it like that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture that is a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
A acts of acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, we put those fibers into each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes on in the environment, creates a tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of this, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we put this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot.
We knew the silk worms to the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, -- distributing <unk> silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk silk to a online silk farm.
And after that, four weeks ago, they were ready to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
Al <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk -- they get all this pavilion out of it.
And in a little more weeks, or three weeks -- <unk> silk worms <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full of empty.
If the last piece of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form a ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature of inspired by the design, which demands us for the first time, that we will take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and developing websites, and also, he was playing the guitar in a punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like testing and persist anyway, because it has spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I would tell me about something else, a totally different thing, and I would focus on it, and I'm going to leave it out and I feel <unk> I've found it and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it out.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
Let me tell you where they did it, they learned about the culture.
So you ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would take to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers into kids like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
I put the <unk> here.
This question is about and over again as we grow in various forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students asked them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before it takes away the dream.
Why?
While this question is inspired by kids to dream about what might be, doesn't inspire dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though well-intentioned adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> Amy editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and a <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to be able to spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you are somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up with curiosity and lots of different things they want to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing bad in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
I could help if you divide up in three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we will have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
At the age of the Renaissance the ideal was who I was good at, in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> whatever you like or <unk> your own your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers here.
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his own shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, traveling math and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
And to Rachel and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is at intersections.
Hence the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all your background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is learning fast.
When we get them, we are interested in something -- we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> because of the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our zones of comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all the things that we have learned to each new area that <unk> so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a young girl who has an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
It had to learn the clearest mechanics of sales when they were starting their practices and this ability to write a number of a compelling amount for the editors.
It's rarely a waste of time to have a waste of time to go to what you would tell you, even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other websites -- sometimes a square designer on Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take a lot of <unk> depending on the needs of its clients.
<unk> originally defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a huge interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing bad in you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep at depth and put in practice, and <unk> offers a width of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and racing careers with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them they were told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the wiring <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all of the media.
That's where you will give the best one.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow her curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
I put the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a more authentic life and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took them to a psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, she passed away in <unk>
After his death, he <unk> he did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen.
But even more surprising happens.
If you were going to have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's been made in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two of them.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your years is going to go from Alzheimer's years from Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or loved with Alzheimer's disease.
Only in America, Alzheimer's costs costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that can't be allowed to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's than other diseases that we spend less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everybody knows, but Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us, all of the scientists, identical Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleashed severe memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points that are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules go <unk> together, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what I would block is complex, like defuse a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
And you have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does it do.
Until recently, in their most part, they have dropped the wires and waiting for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists and mathematicians.
And together, we've actually managed to identify a critical step in the process. We're now testing a new kind of drugs that were using specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that are hitting each other, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at such a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a good outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We've got to hear that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we can get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments and drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to advance HIV in the late '80s.
We see that same unit of overcoming cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often cannot speak for themselves.
And their families, the most hidden, caregivers of their loved ones and night, they're often too much too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the Love Love <unk> New York Times, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test myself myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are going to be <unk> to get a more personal questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple questions for example.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number three: When was it the last time you go to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are more and more personal people.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do or her own, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you would never say to somebody you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really great detail called attention, the point that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with somebody who I knew not particularly well -- I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we had a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Love column, and there's a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking yourselves -- they still go together.
And the reason I think it's challenging this is because they've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
One week before it was published the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had trouble writing about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousands of view.
And that has been a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and already on Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday was already called the USA Show and Good <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million <unk> and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing with respect about self-interest -- but another thing is to discover that life love of one has been news news,  and that people all over the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or writing, what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman rushed up to the stage, "Hey <unk> "Where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers by trying to study it with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and I took orders of photos of us two.
I think he was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love love -- not just an adventure, but it's real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel to respond.
My relationship was just about a few months, and I felt, above all, the wrong question.
How do you know if we go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the researcher goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt more close to doing that, several studies, the later studies, they also used the usual protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between the police and the community and the community used to be used among people from <unk> policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, with four personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts college, and then a student came up to me and said to me, <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
I said, Do you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom you do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but became better friends?
<unk> they can get better known to test the research <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking at when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went to the science.
I did everything I could find on romantic love, and I expected it to kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just studying for the book that I wrote in <unk> really seems to be <unk>
I thought if I was passionate about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you can reasonably demand me to me.
What I'm looking for love is an insurance -- not only about being <unk> today and being <unk> -- but I'm going to keep being threatened by the person I love.
It may be that this is a guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know whether they were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to have to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very controversial story, because it makes us feel <unk> but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story is, still together?
And their content with an answer to Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask ourselves to ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how you live in the question of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still go together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. Love didn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And I shudder a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that they were not supposed to be.
I didn't see a few times we would have both of them to make that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he always chose whether or not.
I want it to be enough to have done it and responded to responded to responded to someone as generous, to love someone as generous, kind of kind of quiet and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what they would do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper -- which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also would love me, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised for a little bit of <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
One of the city in New York City a long time.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of you would find some of you or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has funny because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At one point, he was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and <unk> and all of these things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And he took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking it could be <unk>
Instead, it happens to the opposite: somehow it seemed to grow up of size, as if it was that they would get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add chemical elements, the strange <unk> that was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God -- I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like you do about a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of individuals.
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form sculptures of resin of natural size with pictures of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing:
I didn't know what to do, because the resin would kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on another window window, and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of view.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the <unk> Museum in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 3,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, with this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are run by <unk> ready for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> the shelter of Osama Bin Laden, are all sorts of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk> species.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand goes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail stands for fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go out, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye made out of 1986.
They've got them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It brings me to my last few time.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six years project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one is acting as a sort of a kind of a human being, and you travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm carrying it up.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human trapped inside the inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest, you can <unk> the entrance.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and that you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, he has a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher for these things, because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills they come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, we're in a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a writer, a radio, a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in the inside strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> all of us will die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have the pain, first goes through your stomach, the bowels and other organs.
It's going to take a pill. It's the most effective system and <unk> and so that any drug medicine is going to be on the body.
The <unk> though, is that when you <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and then increase the heart of glial cells.
But they are also known to their side effects <unk> in their negative side effects, because in the time that it takes you to get to the current stream -- you can get worse and worse for the time that it takes to get into its destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV clinic.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the bloodstream of patients that would be given to the regular therapy of antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life running through it is oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "I will make the treatment directly to the <unk> virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for same-sex care and diabetes surgery -- you can be used for anything to <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open up or puncture extremely small holes, which open and closing almost the cells that are infected with HIV to bring drugs.
The best people say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cell membrane living in HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly in the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the <unk> dream in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot at it.
My goal is to understand better to these police agents and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to nonviolent participation.
I do the field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors not government.
For example, the <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of resolution of successful conflicts in the successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, and how do you do this, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and not armed policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk>
From its creation in the 1980s in the 1980s -- <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups are doing more than just to fire.
They're multitasking to you.
They put a complex machine, of <unk> stations. Radio channels, websites web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also going to invest in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through <unk> business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run for hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not provide security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan ripped through war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can be understood we also examined the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases.
But in general, providing social services -- it means to fill an empty <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage -- even in the West, when we look at groups <unk> we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid together.
<unk> because they fill gaps spread across the government, and they emerge like armed groups, political groups, participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can behave as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of an territory, running all of your <unk> they collect the trash, and they run the <unk> system.
It's an state? It's a <unk> group.
Or perhaps something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations and hybrids and the weaker ones are states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the tools of not military tools.
It is <unk> that government gap has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to establish and put peace.
If we understand better at social groups, we'll understand better what incentives to have to encourage the transition from violence to non-violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- not <unk> the military power can win some fights, but we won't make peace or stability.
To make these targets we need long-term investments to fill that gap of security, to fill that gap of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I would love it as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then on the interviews, people started to call him <unk>
So what started as a personal joke -- it meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who might be feminist feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and ugly.
I was shocked, as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is to ask too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It will take the same job for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
Do we have the right to use easy and accessible to contraceptives and services for <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have the other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, of gender, religion and religion and creativity, social condition and a lot more.
We have to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism isn't anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I listen to music to work, I listen to all volume.
Even though the letter degrades into women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you gave you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry isn't it?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical values.
I believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks but also kill insects, <unk> care of grass and maintaining <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of the magazines of fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have some erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that they do happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it is her choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, I agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is rooted in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism who's ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women and gay workers, and <unk> for white, <unk> and high school <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist feminist person.
It also happens to the following: Like <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this <unk> trend in a <unk>
We hope that we will be <unk>
When we were going to go through them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovators and the sector, of the sector, are afraid of being tagged like <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear of what that tag is to be for fear of not being able to fulfill the little realistic.
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist here.
In the <unk> Music 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star star going to come openly feminism feminism and to know women and young men who may be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started seriously debates whether or not exactly feminist.
It will take their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, and we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad challenge, or more well, a more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from to recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy than happy providing a <unk>
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions are moving, it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, gender equality we all deserve to and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and too brave. I want you to grow in a world world.
And they are focusing on the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is all about sexual violence against women and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema on another part when movies are not trying to women more than as an <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their partners as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men -- they may say, "No, I'm not going to publish the magazine, participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't involve a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your desktop or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they would encourage themselves to participate in this kind of projects, we can also encourage ourselves to be even more like us as much as we have to be reluctant to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we're not a <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to come to the top, to the people in terms of producers and producers of film and music and music, <unk> people who can make great decisions, more brave to create a durable and meaningful change.
We can also say with adolescents our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me to <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I believe myself in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me, and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little bit brave, another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I hold the sense that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad graffiti, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I do, and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave when you need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been trained to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune system, it's one of the most easily preventable, diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being an <unk> fraud by British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines are going to be endangered their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her create their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued stable as only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising <unk> like <unk> <unk> which is routinely referred to autism as an HIV epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Control to Atlanta what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis, and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for her son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed to be <unk> worlds a private worlds, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by shaking their hands to their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toys on their usual spot without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the years of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, I would try to give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 kids sent for other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents, <unk>
These kids, he said, have been kept in a refrigerator they didn't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster into certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents who had been able to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to try and test theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a psychologist, cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of mothers and <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as black-eyed Susie, without special education, and no special education without any diagnosis.
In order to defend the National Department of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism in the general population.
I took a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse reality.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, -- in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted models.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did you not realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation in the English language, but luckily, the <unk> husband spoke German, and he was ready for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was running an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with differences of learning were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in your clinic started with music with music, and kids were still their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, described described as <unk> disability for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, as patients, he called them their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were especially good for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that spanned an amazing variety of frequency and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in temperate culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He went beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic criteria that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by one broad and inclusive.
These changes were not <unk> broken up.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with <unk> to reform these <unk> people all over the world saw an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out -- <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they're introduced early clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect -- a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected that it were, making people with autism and their families finally supported the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for increasing <unk> and <unk> and <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center is that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, they're right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that these are puzzles for solving for new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of living living systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows -- doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects, are found in the understanding of the teachers, employers with ability, communities with ability, communities and fathers in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we spread into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste your brain.
Thank you.
